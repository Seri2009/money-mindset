    "content": "## By John Jean Hanna\n\nInvesting in property is something many adults talk about, and for good reason. Real estate can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time, but like any investment, it comes with both risks and rewards. As high school students looking ahead to your financial futures, it’s important to understand the basics. In this article, I’ll break down what real estate investing really means, what makes it appealing, and what you should watch out for.\n\n## **What is Real Estate Investment?** \nReal estate investment means buying property; like a house, apartment, or land, with the goal of making money from it. This can happen in two main ways:\n\n1. **Rental income**: You earn money by renting the property to someone else.\n\n2. **Property value increase (appreciation)**: You buy a property and sell it later for more than you paid.\n\nIt’s not just about buying a place to live, it’s about using property as a tool to grow your financial future.\n\n## **Key Points about Real Estate Investing:**\n\nReal estate investing involves buying physical property to generate income and build wealth. Investors can earn monthly rent, providing steady cash flow, while properties often increase in value over time. This combination makes real estate a popular long-term wealth-building strategy.\n\n## **Why Do People Invest in Property?**\n\nPeople invest in real estate for several key reasons. One major benefit is steady income, as monthly rent can provide reliable cash flow. Over time, property values often grow, increasing the overall return on investment. Real estate also offers tax benefits, with opportunities for deductions and breaks that can reduce taxable income. Lastly, it provides a sense of stability, as the real estate market is generally less volatile than stocks, making it an attractive long-term investment option.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcZYbvKOz3KWWZYahVCWeZeqJ9H2XZa-nKw5X3eQTLyVCdG2pa_lVlABhXHwDKOR6VlmB5R73xau-DPKW2DbO8ScDDa1evQPyaaJtYYdOkrM8EnqsQTvzDwnirzTFkK907Mux5eVg?key=WvepuRP4_FqxzKkNmRlPjg)\n\n## **Main Pros and Cons at a Glance**\n\nInvesting in rental property comes with a range of pros and cons across different features. Monthly income is a major advantage, as rental income can provide a steady stream of cash; however, a downside is that renters may not always pay on time. In terms of long-term value, properties usually appreciate over time, but this is not guaranteed—market crashes can significantly reduce property values. Regarding control, owning rental property allows you to manage the asset directly, but this also means it requires your time, effort, and regular maintenance. When it comes to risk level, real estate is generally seen as relatively stable, yet it still carries risk depending on factors like location and market conditions. Lastly, while the entry cost to property investment can lead to wealth-building over time, it comes with high upfront expenses, including the down payment and taxes.\n\n## **Why Does This Matter?** \nUnderstanding real estate early on gives you a head start. It’s not just for adults with big savings, young people can start learning now, so when the time comes, they know how to make smart decisions. Property can be a great way to grow wealth, but it’s not magic. It takes research, responsibility, and planning.\n\n## **Tips for Future Real Estate Investors**\n\nBefore diving into real estate, it's important to learn the market by researching different areas and understanding how property prices change over time. Start saving early, as you'll need a down payment and extra funds for maintenance and unexpected costs. Always think long-term, since real estate success often comes from patience rather than quick profits. Finally, don’t ignore the risks; property values can decrease, and renters may be unreliable, so always plan with caution.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfU_lka1gdviOPmMNIYszBJ0TyXLIt9qK1qcHgTHBS4TzjS6BTziECRxUejIEttb5grGEu7qItYxGAxX_1lS26owmEBjtyJomT0hd3biIvE7NNDSpZWF7DlsEdUZ_u_sxTZW7jCOA?key=WvepuRP4_FqxzKkNmRlPjg)\n\n## **Final Thoughts** \nReal estate can be a smart and powerful investment, especially for those who take the time to understand how it works. While it’s not a guaranteed path to riches, it offers the potential for long-term financial stability. As a high school student, knowing the basics now prepares you to make smarter, more confident decisions in the future; whether you buy your first home, invest in rental property, or simply understand how the property market works.",

    "content": "## By Dimitri Tobok\n\nIf you’ve ever thought about starting a business, running a fundraiser, or even selling something online, you’ve probably heard the terms revenue and profit. A lot of people confuse them, but they’re not the same thing. In fact, knowing the difference is one of the most important steps toward becoming financially smart.\n\nLet’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.\n\n\n## **What Is Revenue?**\n\nRevenue is the _total amount of money_ a business brings in from selling its products or services. It doesn’t matter how much it costs to make the product, revenue is just the full amount people paid you. (Selling Price x Quantity sold)\n\nThink of it like this: if you sold 100 t-shirts for $20 each, your revenue would be $2,000. Simple, right? That’s the money coming _in_.\n\nBut here’s the catch: _revenue is not profit._\n\n\n## **What Is Profit?**\n\nProfit is what’s **left over** after you pay all the costs to run your business. That includes everything, materials, advertising, shipping, website fees, and more.\n\nSo, using the t-shirt example again, let’s say it cost you:\n\n- $1,000 to print the shirts\n\n- $300 on ads\n\n- $100 for shipping and packaging\n\nThat’s **$1,400 in expenses**.\n\n&#x20;You made $2,000 in revenue, but after subtracting your $1,400 in costs, your **profit** is only **$600**.\n\nIn short: _Revenue is what you make. Profit is what you keep._\n\n## **Why the Difference Matters**\n\nIt’s super easy to brag about how much you made in sales, but if you spent just as much (or more) than you earned, you’re not really ahead. You might even be losing money (this is called a loss). \n\nMany businesses fail not because they didn’t sell enough, but because they didn’t manage their costs properly. That’s why _profit tells the real story_ of how healthy or successful a business truly is.\n\nAlso, when investors or partners look at a business, they don’t just ask how much money it made. They want to know: \"How much are you keeping after all your bills are paid?**\"** That’s the number that matters.\n\n\n## **Real-Life Example for Teens**\n\nLet’s say you start selling homemade bracelets at school or online. You charge $5 each and sell 50 of them. That’s $250 in revenue. ($5 x 50)\n\nBut you spent $100 on beads, $30 on packaging, and $20 on delivery supplies. Your total expenses are $150.\n\nYour profit? Only $100. ($250 - $150)\n\nThat’s still awesome! But now you understand that the money in your pocket at the end of the day isn’t the same as your total sales. And that’s what makes you smarter than most new business owners.\n\n## **Finishing Thoughts**\n\nUnderstanding the difference between revenue and profit isn’t just for business majors or CEOs, it’s for anyone who wants to be financially aware. Whether you're starting a side hustle, managing a school project, or just curious about how real businesses work, keep this in mind: \n\n- **Revenue is the big number. Profit is the important one.**\n\n- Once you start thinking this way, you’ll approach money with a sharper, smarter mindset, and that’s a skill _you’ll_ use for life.",

    "image": "/article-images/dream-career-vs-financial-security.jpg",
    "content": "## By Khaled Adib\n\nOne of the most significant decisions university students face is choosing a career path that aligns with both their personal aspirations and their financial needs. For many, this decision involves weighing the pursuit of a dream career against the necessity of financial security. A dream career often represents passion, purpose, and creative fulfillment, while financial security offers stability, predictability, and the resources required to live independently and responsibly. Balancing these two goals is a challenge that requires careful planning, realistic expectations, and a commitment to both self-awareness and financial literacy.\n\n\n## Dream Careers vs. Financial Security\n\nDream careers typically reflect an individual’s intrinsic motivations and interests. Students may aspire to become artists, writers, social workers, or entrepreneurs, roles that offer meaning and personal satisfaction but may not guarantee a stable or sufficient income, especially in the early stages. In contrast, careers associated with financial security, such as those in engineering, healthcare, or finance, tend to provide consistent salaries, benefits, and clear advancement paths, though they may not always align with one’s passions. This creates a tension between following a path that inspires and one that ensures economic well-being.\n\n\n## The Value of Passion and Mental Well-being\n\nNonetheless, pursuing passion remains important for long-term career satisfaction and mental health. Research indicates that individuals who are engaged and emotionally invested in their work often demonstrate higher levels of resilience, creativity, and persistence. Over time, these qualities can translate into career growth and success, even in fields that initially offer limited financial rewards. However, it is equally important to acknowledge the reality of financial responsibilities. Without a stable income, individuals may experience chronic stress, limited opportunities for personal development, and reduced freedom to make meaningful life choices.\n\n\n## Practical Strategies for Balancing Both\n\nTo navigate this complex landscape, students can adopt a number of practical strategies. One of the most effective approaches is to begin with a dual-track plan: maintain a stable job that meets financial needs while gradually building experience and credibility in one’s field of interest. For example, a student passionate about filmmaking may choose to work in digital marketing or content production, acquiring transferable skills while developing independent projects on the side. This approach allows for both professional development and income generation without requiring an immediate or risky leap into uncertain territory.\n\n\n## Financial Literacy as a Tool for Flexibility\n\nAnother important strategy is financial planning. Living below one’s means, creating a monthly budget, and building an emergency fund can provide the flexibility to take calculated risks when opportunities arise. Learning how to manage expenses and prioritize saving empowers individuals to make career decisions based on goals rather than immediate financial pressure. In addition, investing in education and skill development can increase the marketability of one's passion. For instance, an aspiring writer who learns digital publishing or marketing can reach wider audiences and create alternative income streams, thereby increasing the sustainability of their chosen path.\n\n\n## Setting Goals and Adapting Over Time\n\nSetting realistic short-term and long-term goals is also essential. A clear timeline, such as transitioning to full-time creative work within five years, provides structure and motivation. It is important to regularly assess progress and remain adaptable in the face of changing circumstances. Many successful professionals did not start in their ideal roles but made strategic moves over time to align their work with their passions. A practical example is a graduate who begins in a corporate communications role to build savings and then shifts into nonprofit advocacy or public policy once financially stable.\n\n\n## Conclusion: Integrating Passion with Practicality\n\nUltimately, the choice between a dream career and financial security does not have to be mutually exclusive. With foresight, discipline, and a willingness to adapt, students can design a professional path that honors both their ambitions and their responsibilities. Balancing these two priorities involves trade-offs, but it also opens the door to a more intentional and fulfilling career. By developing strong financial habits and approaching career decisions with both passion and pragmatism, students can position themselves for a future that is both meaningful and secure.",

    "content": "## By Khaled Adib\n\nSovereign debt default is one of the most serious events in global finance. It occurs when a country cannot meet its debt obligations, such as missing payments on bonds or international loans. While corporate defaults go through bankruptcy courts, sovereign default plays out through informal negotiation, global politics, and painful economic adjustment.\n\nThe process is complex and often messy. Creditors want to recover their money. The debtor government wants to regain financial stability and access to international markets. Both sides must navigate legal contracts, economic realities, and political constraints. In this article, we break down the concept of sovereign default, the different forms it can take, and what we can learn from recent cases such as Argentina and Sri Lanka\n\n**What Is a Sovereign Default?**\n\nA sovereign default occurs when a national government fails to pay interest or principal on its debt. Not all missed payments count as defaults. Rating agencies and markets generally recognize three major types:\n\n- **Hard default**: This is a missed payment beyond the contractual grace period (often 30 days). If a bond’s interest payment is not made on time, this usually triggers an official downgrade to default status.\n\n- **Technical default**: This includes non-payment due to administrative errors, or violations of loan covenants. These are typically minor and may be resolved quickly without triggering full default status.\n\n- **Distressed exchange**: This is when a government offers creditors a new debt contract with significantly worse terms than the original. Even if payments continue under the new terms, rating agencies often consider this a form of default.\n\nCredit ratings like \"Selective Default\" or \"Restricted Default\" often describe cases where only part of a country’s debt is affected. The legal status depends on the governing law in bond contracts. For instance, most international bonds are issued under New York or English law. These contracts often include Collective Action Clauses (CACs), which allow a supermajority of creditors to approve restructuring terms that bind all bondholders. Still, holdout creditors can try to block restructurings by suing, as in Argentina’s infamous litigation battles.\n\n\n## **Why Do Countries Default?**\n\nSovereign defaults often follow a familiar pattern. Debt levels rise, investor confidence weakens, and a sudden shock (such as a currency collapse, oil price spike, or recession) makes debt payments unsustainable.\n\nThe economic impact of default is severe. Countries typically face capital flight, high inflation, a banking crisis, and a deep recession. Politically, governments often fall, and social unrest rises. The IMF, World Bank, and regional partners may step in with emergency funding, but often on tough terms.\n\n\n## **Case Study 1: Argentina (2001 and 2020)**\n\n**What happened**: In 2001 Argentina defaulted on about $93 billion in external debt, at the time the largest sovereign default in history. This came after years of recession, a currency peg that drained reserves, and growing fiscal deficits. The government froze bank accounts and abandoned its dollar peg. A collapse followed.\n\n**How the default unfolded**: Argentina suspended payments on its bonds and began a years-long restructuring. It launched debt exchanges in 2005 and 2010, offering deep haircuts. About 93 percent of creditors accepted. However, a small group of holdouts refused and sued in U.S. courts. They won, and in 2014 a judge blocked Argentina from paying any creditors unless holdouts were paid too. This led to a technical re-default until settlements were reached in 2016.\n\n**Aftermath**: Argentina suffered a GDP contraction of 11 percent in 2002. Unemployment and poverty surged. Eventually, growth returned, fueled by high commodity prices. Yet Argentina never fully regained investor confidence. Another default occurred in 2020, when it restructured $65 billion under President Alberto Fernández.\n\n\n## **Case Study 2: Sri Lanka (2022)**\n\n**What happened**: Sri Lanka suspended foreign debt payments in April 2022, becoming the first Asia-Pacific country to default in the 21st century. This followed a collapse in tourism due to COVID-19, tax cuts that reduced revenue, and a costly fertilizer ban that hurt agriculture. Foreign reserves ran dry, and the government could no longer afford essential imports.\n\n**How the default unfolded**: Sri Lanka missed coupon payments on foreign bonds and quickly began negotiations with the IMF. By March 2023, it had secured a $3 billion program. The government also negotiated restructuring deals with bilateral lenders such as India, China, and Japan, as well as private bondholders.\n\n**Aftermath**: Inflation hit nearly 70 percent, the rupee lost half its value, and daily life was disrupted by fuel and medicine shortages. The president resigned following mass protests. In 2024, the economy began stabilizing with support from international institutions, though full recovery depends on completing the restructuring and restoring investor trust.\n\n\n## **Lessons from Sovereign Defaults**\n\n- **Restructuring is painful**. Economic contraction, inflation, and unemployment almost always follow a default.\n\n- **Legal contracts matter**. The ability of holdouts to sue depends on jurisdiction. CACs reduce the risk of protracted litigation.\n\n- **IMF involvement is key**. Most restructurings are supported by IMF programs. These typically require fiscal reforms, transparency measures, and creditor coordination.\n\n- **Timing matters**. Preemptive restructurings (before cash runs out) are less damaging than messy defaults. Sri Lanka’s default was relatively orderly compared to Argentina’s.\n\n- **Recovery takes years**. Regaining market access is not quick. Even after settlements, countries may remain cut off from borrowing or face higher interest rates.\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nSovereign default is not the end of the road, but it is a hard reset. For governments, it tests the limits of political leadership and economic planning. For investors, it underscores the importance of legal protections and risk diversification. Whether caused by poor governance, bad luck, or global shocks, sovereign defaults will continue to shape emerging markets in the years ahead.\n\nUnderstanding how and why they happen is essential for anyone involved in international finance.",

    "slug": "how-central-banks-around-the-world-are-responding-to-inflation",

    "image": "/article-images/how-central-banks-around-the-world-are-responding-to-inflation.jpg",
    "content": "## By Seri Kanj\n\nInflation has been a key concern for economies worldwide over the past few years. After the pandemic, inflation surged in many countries due to supply chain disruptions, increased consumer demand, and geopolitical tensions. In 2025, inflation is slowing in some places but remains stubbornly high in others. To keep economies stable and protect purchasing power, central banks are using a mix of strategies to manage this ongoing challenge.\n\n## **The Role of Central Banks**\n\nCentral banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank in the EU, are responsible for keeping inflation under control, usually aiming for a target of around 2 percent. They do this mainly by adjusting interest rates, buying or selling government bonds, and managing the money supply. When inflation gets too high, they usually raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and encourage saving, which slows down spending and helps prices stabilize.\n\n## **The U.S. Federal Reserve: Cautious but Firm**\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in 2022 and continued into 2023 and 2024. By early 2025, inflation has slowed but remains above the Fed’s target. As a result, the Fed is holding rates steady for now, signaling that it wants to see more consistent progress before cutting rates. This cautious approach is meant to avoid repeating past mistakes, where lowering rates too soon led to inflation coming back.\n\n## **European Central Bank: Balancing Growth and Prices**\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) faces a slightly different challenge. While inflation has eased in countries like Germany and France, energy prices and food costs are still elevated in parts of Europe. The ECB has kept interest rates relatively high but is also looking closely at economic growth, which has been slower than expected. In 2025, the ECB is trying to strike a balance between keeping inflation under control and not pushing the region into recession.\n\n## **Emerging Markets: A Tougher Fight**\n\nCountries like Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa are also battling inflation, but their tools are more limited. Many of these central banks raised interest rates aggressively over the past two years. In 2025, some are starting to lower them slightly, hoping inflation will stay low while supporting growth. However, they must also worry about foreign investors pulling out their money if interest rates fall too much, which could weaken their currencies and drive prices back up.\n\n## **China and Japan: A Different Story**\n\nInterestingly, not every country is dealing with high inflation. In China and Japan, inflation remains quite low. In fact, both countries are more concerned about slow economic growth than rising prices. In response, their central banks are keeping interest rates low and using other tools to boost lending and investment. These economies are focusing on long-term stability rather than fighting inflation.\n\n## **Looking Ahead**\n\nThe global fight against inflation in 2025 is far from over. Central banks are walking a tightrope: if they act too slowly, inflation could stay high and hurt everyday consumers. If they act too aggressively, they could trigger job losses and slower growth. The key is finding the right balance, and that balance looks different in every country.\n\nFor the average person, central bank policies may seem distant or abstract. But they shape the interest rates on our loans, the value of our money, and the stability of our economies. As 2025 unfolds, staying informed about these decisions helps us better understand the world we live in and the forces shaping our financial future.",

The article also seeks to inform young entrepreneurs and students on the key components of a strong brand and provide practical tips for building a memorable and trustworthy brand identity in a diverse and fast-paced city like Dubai.\n\n## What is Branding, Really?\nBranding is not just about having a cool logo or a catchy slogan. It’s the personality of your business. It’s how people feel when they hear your name, view your packaging, or visit your store. From your business colors to the way you talk to customers, every little detail adds up to create your brand. It’s the overall experience of your product or service.\n\n## Why is Branding Super Important?\n\n#### First Impressions Matter\nJust like when you meet someone for the first time, businesses only get one chance to make a first impression. A good brand helps your business look professional and trustworthy from the start.\n\n#### Branding Builds Trust\nIn a city like Dubai, where there is a plethora of options for almost everything, customers usually choose brands they know and trust. A strong brand can make customers feel safe, like they’re making the right choice.\n\n#### Helps You Stand Out\nWhether you're selling cupcakes in Jumeirah or tech products online, you need to be different from your competitors. Branding helps your business show what makes it special: your story, your vibe, your values.\n\n#### Connects You with Customers Emotionally\nThink about brands like Nike or Emirates Airlines. People don’t just buy their products; they buy the feeling they get. A powerful brand sells experiences that trigger emotions, and positive emotions lead to a strong and loyal customer base.\n\n#### Supports Your Marketing Efforts\nWhen your brand is strong and clear, it makes your advertising and social media posts much more effective. People recognize you faster, and they’re more likely to respond.\n\n## Branding in Dubai: A City of Innovation\nDubai is a place where businesses grow quickly and competition is everywhere. This is naturally an environment where businesses can thrive. However, with so many new startups and businesses, branding is crucial here. Tourists, residents, and investors all interact with brands every day. Therefore, if you want your business to succeed in this environment, your brand must shine.\n\n## Tips for Building a Strong Brand\n- **Know your mission** – What does your business stand for?  \n- **Be consistent** – Use the same colors, fonts, and tone everywhere.  \n- **Understand your audience** – Who are you trying to reach?  \n- **Stay professional** – Even small businesses can look high-quality.  \n- **Keep improving** – Great brands keep learning and growing.\n\n## Conclusion\nBranding is so much more than a business trend – it is an absolute necessity for success. Whether you're launching a café in Downtown Dubai or running an online store from your bedroom, investing in your brand is similar to planting seeds for future growth. A memorable brand can help your business grow faster, connect deeper, and go further.",

    "content": "### By Dimitre Tobok\n\n## **What Is BRICS?**\n\nThe BRICS association, consisting primarily of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has significantly expanded its global influence since its establishment. With the recent inclusion of countries like Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Nigeria, the bloc now represents over half of the world's population and a substantial portion of global GDP when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\n\n## **BRICS' Expanding Economic Footprint**\n\nAs of 2025, the expanded BRICS group accounts for approximately 42.2% of global GDP (PPP) and 54.6% of the world's population. This growth reflects the bloc's increasing appeal to emerging economies seeking alternatives to traditional Western-led financial institutions.([ Just International](https://just-international.org/articles/brics-expands-to-54-6-of-world-population-by-adding-nigeria-africas-most-populous-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) \n\nThe inclusion of resource rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE enhances BRICS' influence over global energy markets. Collectively, the bloc now controls about 44% of global oil reserves, positioning it as a significant player in the global energy landscape.[ TASS](https://tass.com/economy/1664817?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n## **Initiatives Toward Financial Independence**\n\nIn 2015, BRICS established the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member countries and other emerging economies. The NDB aims to address the significant investment gap in infrastructure and to provide emerging economies with a greater voice in the global financial system.[ (BRICS](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nAdditionally, BRICS nations are exploring alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade. While the idea of a unified BRICS currency has been discussed, significant challenges remain due to the diverse economic structures and political systems of member countries. Instead, the bloc is focusing on increasing the use of local currencies in bilateral trade agreements.\n\n\n## **Challenges and Internal Dynamics**\n\nDespite its growing economic clout, BRICS faces internal challenges, including differing political systems and economic priorities among member states. Tensions between China and India, as well as varying levels of development and governance structures, pose obstacles to cohesive policy making.\n\nMoreover, while there are discussions about reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, implementing a unified BRICS currency would require significant political and economic alignment, which remains a complex endeavor.\n\n\n## **Future Outlook**\n\nThe expansion and initiatives of BRICS signify a shift toward a more multipolar global economic order. As the bloc continues to grow and assert its influence, it presents both opportunities and challenges for the existing international financial architecture. Monitoring BRICS' developments will be crucial for understanding the future dynamics of global economic governance. For the global economy, this could mean a rebalancing of power away from traditional Western institutions like the IMF and World Bank, increased use of local currencies in trade, greater influence from emerging economies in setting financial norms, and intensified competition in global markets.\n\n## **MLA CITATIONS**\n\n**BRICS Data – Official Site** **\"BRICS Data.\"** _BRICS_, Government of Brazil,[ https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data).

    "content": "## By Sami Chatila.\n\nEveryone in life should understand the differences between credit and debit cards. They are similar in some ways but different in others. They each have their own unique purposes and they both have pros and cons. In this article I will delve into the differences, similarities and everything in between.\n\n\n## **What is a Debit Card?**\n\nThe money on your debit card is directly sourced from your personal bank account. If you complete a transaction with your debit card, the money spent is taken from your account right away or within a couple of days depending on the country you're in or the bank you are a customer of. You can picture it as paying for products or services using money that you don't physically have in your pocket. \n\n**Key points about debit cards:**\n\n- You can only spend the money you already have in your account.\n\n- There’s usually no interest because you’re not borrowing money.\n\n- Great for everyday purchases and controlling spending.\n\n- Some debit cards offer rewards or cash back, but not always.\n\n\n## **What is a Credit Card?**\n\nCredit cards are the more popular choice by the population. They allow you to receive a loan from the bank or company that you are a customer of. Depending on your credit score which is determined by many different factors like your ability to pay credit card bills on time, you might receive a higher loan amount or credit card limit. However, these loans are not as amazing as they seem. This is because you must pay back these loans every month or bimonthly along with interest, and if you don't pay on time you will be in debt which can be stressful.\n\n**Key points about credit cards:**\n\n- You can spend money you don’t currently have, up to a credit limit.\n\n- You’ll receive a bill each month and must pay at least a minimum amount.\n\n- If you pay off your balance in full, you avoid interest charges.\n\n- Can help build your credit history, which is important for things like loans.\n\n- Often offer rewards like points, cash back, or travel miles.\n\n\n## **Why Does This Matter?**\n\nDebit cards allow people to control their spending, without going into debt. However, credit cards can be beneficial as by building your credit score, it can award you with different benefits and perks. However using a credit card carelessly can be a very dangerous task that can put you in severe debt \n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd11mJyt6L4B_B0MkZfEc8ZTfDlsuykjwWsZMwXDl6HlW2m5GGAPoAfu6lIoZNCTBNHMcOSB9qcszW-9mQ7D1scC6aPNHl7NbtuH0kwpLVssWH5mpv-bXe7Q1dL_ifJFej2ap0d9g?key=pC5XbuUVL-OF0Wm7eTEg2Q)\n\n\n## **Tips for Smart Use**\n\n* **Debit:** Keep track of your balance to avoid overdraft fees.\n\n* **Credit:** Pay your bill in full each month to avoid interest.\n\n* **Both:** Monitor your statements regularly for errors or fraud.\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nBoth debit and credit cards have their own advantages and disadvantages. Understanding how each one works as a student in highschool is extremely important, as it helps you make smarter money decisions and build a strong financial future right from the start.",

    "content": "## By Dimitre Tobok.\n\nAs a student, managing money can feel overwhelming, especially with tuition, books, food, and the occasional (or frequent) bubble tea splurge. But there’s one timeless budgeting method that can help anyone, even with a modest income, get a handle on their finances, presenting the ultimate 50/30/20 rule.\n\n\n## **What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?**\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule is a simple yet powerful budgeting technique popularized by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren in her 2005 book _All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan_, co-authored with her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi. The idea is straightforward: divide your after-tax income into three categories—50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment. As Emirates Islamic explains, this rule is \"an easy, intuitive plan on daily spending and saving towards emergencies\" (\"50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance\").\n\nLet’s break each category down with a student-friendly perspective.\n\n**50%: Needs, Survive First, Then Thrive**\n\nYour “needs” are essentials; things you absolutely must pay for to practically stay alive. This includes rent, groceries, transportation, basic utilities, health insurance, and minimum debt payments. As Emirates Islamic puts it, these are “must-have living expenses,” and if they exceed 50% of your income, “it may be time to consider downsizing” or finding cheaper alternatives.\n\nFor students, this might mean sharing an apartment, using public transportation, or switching from brand-name groceries to more affordable ones. It’s not glamorous, but it’s practical.\n\n\n **30%: Wants,  Life’s Joyful Extras**\n\nWants are what make life enjoyable but aren’t necessary for survival. Think of outings with friends, streaming services, eating out, fashion upgrades, or new gadgets.\n\nThe key here is recognizing the difference between wants and needs. As the Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia (KWSP) puts it, this rule “is a straightforward way to balance your spending and savings, giving you more control over your finances and a greater sense of security” (\"The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend\").\n\nThat latte you grab every day? Probably a want, not a need. Being honest with yourself about these categories is half the budgeting battle.\n\n**20%: Savings,  Pay Your Future First**\n\nThe final 20% goes toward savings and debt reduction. This might be your emergency fund, a savings account, retirement contributions, or student loan repayments above the minimum.\n\nForbes emphasizes the importance of this category: “This is all about sacrificing spending in the present to benefit your future self” (Tepper and Benninger). Whether you’re saving up for a post-graduation trip or just want a safety cushion, building the habit now sets you up for long-term financial freedom.\n\n\n## **Why It Works, Especially for Students**\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this rule is its simplicity. As Forbes notes, “Rather than using a zero-based budget, where you assign a purpose to every dollar of income, the 50/30/20 rule allows you to fudge it” (Tepper and Benninger). This makes it less intimidating, perfect for students just starting out on their financial journey.\n\nMoreover, Emirates Islamic highlights how this rule “can help you plan ahead, for the medium and long-term,” offering both flexibility and structure for anyone trying to get their finances in shape.\n\n\n## **Real-Life Example**\n\nLet’s say you earn AED 3,000 a month from a part-time job or allowance:\n\n- **AED 1,500 (50%)** – Needs: rent, transport, groceries, data plan\n\n- **AED 900 (30%)** – Wants: shopping, eating out, Netflix\n\n- **AED 600 (20%)** – Savings: emergency fund, extra loan payments, future investments\n\nEven small amounts saved monthly can grow significantly over time, especially when placed in a high-interest savings account.\n\n\n## **Final Thoughts: Is It Right for You?**\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule isn’t one-size-fits-all. Some students may need to allocate more to needs or cut back drastically on wants. KWSP notes that “depending on your financial situation, this rule can be adjusted to better suit your needs” (\"The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend\").\n\nStill, if you’re new to budgeting, this method gives you a strong foundation without drowning you in spreadsheets or complicated apps. It’s all  about balance, ensuring your present lifestyle doesn’t sabotage your future goals.\n\nSo next time you get paid, pause before spending and try this method. You might just find yourself saving more, and stressing less.\n\n\n## **Works Cited (MLA Format)**\n\nEmirates Islamic. “50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance.” _Emirates Islamic_,[ https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/en/key-information/50-30-20-rule-of-personal-finance](https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/en/key-information/50-30-20-rule-of-personal-finance).
