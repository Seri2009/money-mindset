    "content": "### By Seri Kanj\n\nIf you‚Äôre planning to major in **finance**, you‚Äôre already on track to gain valuable skills in money management, investments, and financial decision-making. But in a world where employers are looking for well-rounded, adaptable talent, adding a **minor** to your degree can give you a competitive edge, and help you explore other areas you‚Äôre passionate about.\n\nA well-chosen minor doesn‚Äôt just fill out your schedule. It can strengthen your resume, improve your problem-solving skills, and even help you discover new career paths you hadn‚Äôt considered. Below are some of the **best minors** to consider pairing with a finance major, each offering practical benefits depending on your goals.\n\n\n### **1. Computer Science**\n\nAs finance becomes more tech-driven, computer science is one of the most powerful pairings. You'll learn programming, algorithms, and how to build or understand the technology behind trading systems and financial apps. Whether you want to go into **quantitative finance**, work at a fintech startup, or simply make your Excel skills stronger, this minor prepares you for the digital side of finance.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Tech fluency is becoming essential for analysts, bankers, and finance professionals alike.\n\n\n### **2. Economics**\n\nWhile finance looks at how individuals and companies manage money, economics focuses on how economies and policies influence markets. This minor helps you understand inflation, interest rates, international trade, and economic cycles, an important context for any finance role, especially in banking, investment strategy, or economic consulting.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Gives you a broader understanding of global financial systems and market behavior.\n\n\n### **3. Mathematics or Statistics**\n\nMath and stats are the language of finance. If you're interested in investment analysis, risk management, or becoming an actuary, these fields will give you the tools to build models, evaluate uncertainty, and draw conclusions from complex data.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Deepens your analytical skills and helps with everything from portfolio management to pricing financial products.\n\n\n### **4. Accounting**\n\nAccounting gives you a closer look at how businesses operate internally. You‚Äôll learn how to read balance sheets, track expenses, and understand tax laws. This minor is especially useful for careers in **corporate finance, audit, or investment banking**, where understanding a company‚Äôs financial health is essential.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Enhances your ability to analyze financial statements and work with real-world financial data.\n\n\n### **5. Data Analytics**\n\nFinance professionals are expected to make decisions based on data. With a minor in data analytics, you‚Äôll learn how to organize, interpret, and visualize large data sets using tools like Excel, R, or Tableau. This is especially valuable in areas like market research, financial forecasting, and strategic planning.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Adds critical thinking and tech tools to your skillset, helping you back up decisions with hard data.\n\n\n### **6. Foreign Language**\n\nIf you're interested in international finance or working in global markets, a foreign language minor can open doors. Knowing languages like **Mandarin, Spanish, French, or Arabic** makes it easier to work across borders, understand different cultures, and connect with global clients or firms.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Global business relies on communication‚Äîand knowing another language gives you a unique advantage.\n\n\n### **7. Entrepreneurship**\n\nThinking of starting your own business? A minor in entrepreneurship helps you develop an innovative mindset, covering topics like startup strategy, venture capital, and business planning. It‚Äôs especially useful for finance students who want to go into private equity, venture investing, or launch their own companies someday.\n\n**Why it‚Äôs useful:** Teaches you to think creatively, manage uncertainty, and lead projects with confidence.\n\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nYour finance major teaches you how money works‚Äîbut your minor can show the world how _you_ think. Whether you're interested in tech, data, strategy, or global impact, there‚Äôs a minor that can enhance your strengths and help you reach your goals.\n\nIn the end, combining finance with the right minor isn't just about doing more‚Äîit's about doing _smarter_.\n\nAnd remember,¬† in a world where skills intersect, the best opportunities often lie at the crossroads.",

    "content": "### By Dimitre Tobok\n\nIf you‚Äôre a teen and you‚Äôve ever wondered, ‚ÄúCan I actually invest in the stock market?‚Äù The short answer is: **yes**, but with a little help. Investing might sound like something only adults do, but the truth is, you don‚Äôt have to wait until you‚Äôre older to start building wealth. In fact, starting early is one of the best advantages you can give yourself. So let‚Äôs break it down: how it works, what you need to get started, and why it matters.\n\n## How It Works: Custodial Accounts\n\nBecause you‚Äôre under 18, you can‚Äôt legally open your own brokerage account (the kind used to buy stocks). But here‚Äôs the good news: you can invest through what‚Äôs called a custodial account. That‚Äôs an account your parent or guardian opens on your behalf. They control the account until you turn 18 or 21 (depending on where you live), but the money is yours. And you can help choose where it goes, like into individual stocks or ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds).Think of it as a teamwork account: they manage the setup, you help guide the strategy.\n\n## Where to Start\n\nThere are several teen-friendly investing platforms that offer custodial accounts, and many allow you to start with just a small amount of money. Apps like Fidelity Youth, Greenlight, and Step are popular options that are easy to use and designed with young investors in mind. Once your account is set up, you can begin exploring:\n\nStocks, small pieces of ownership in companies you like.\n\nETFs, bundles of stocks that offer more diversification. \n\nFractional shares, letting you invest in big-name companies with as little as $1The key is to start simple and focus on learning rather than trying to make fast money.\n\n### **Why Start Now?**\n\nThe biggest benefit of investing as a teen is time. Even if you only invest small amounts, your money has more years to grow. That‚Äôs because of something called compound interest, where your earnings earn more earnings over time.For example, investing $100 at age 16 could be worth more than $1,000 by the time you‚Äôre 40, without doing anything else. The earlier you start, the more your money can grow\\.Plus, learning how the stock market works while you're young gives you a head start on financial confidence and decision-making.\n\n### **Things to Keep in Mind**\n\nInvesting involves risk. Stocks can go up and down, so it‚Äôs important to think long-term and not panic if things drop temporarily.\n\nDon‚Äôt invest money you‚Äôll need soon. The stock market is better for long-term goals, not next week‚Äôs concert tickets.\n\nLearn as you go. Read up on how companies work, what drives prices, and how to spot smart opportunities. The more you understand, the better decisions you‚Äôll make.\n\n### **Final Takeaway**\n\nYes, teens _can_ invest in the stock market. You just need a little support and the right mindset. Starting now, even with small amounts, can set you up for a stronger financial future.You don‚Äôt need to be an expert or have thousands of dollars. You just need curiosity, patience, and a willingness to learn. Because the earlier you start investing in your future, the more it pays off.",

    "image": "/article-images/what-makes-a-target-school-for-investment-banking.webp",
    "content": "### By Seri Kanj\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in a career in investment banking, you may have heard the term ‚Äútarget school.‚Äù But what exactly does that mean, and why does it matter? Understanding this can help you plan your path and stay motivated, no matter where you study.\n\n## What Is a Target School?\n\nA target school is a college or university where investment banks actively recruit students for internships and full-time jobs. These schools usually have strong finance programs, great reputations, and many alumni working in banking. Because banks visit these campuses regularly, students have easier access to interviews, networking events, and recruiting workshops.\n\n## Why Do Banks Focus on Target Schools?\n\nInvestment banks want to hire the best candidates efficiently. Target schools provide a steady stream of talented students who are trained in relevant skills, like financial modeling, economics, and business communication. The banks also benefit from the strong alumni networks at these schools, which helps with referrals and mentoring.\n\n## Examples of Target Schools\n\nSome of the most common target schools for investment banking include: University of Pennsylvania (Wharton), Harvard University, Stanford University, University of Chicago (Booth), and Columbia University.\n\nThese schools are often on banks‚Äô official recruiting lists. But keep in mind, this list is not fixed. Some banks recruit from other universities, too.\n\n## What If You‚Äôre Not at a Target School?\n\nHere‚Äôs the important part: being at a non-target school does NOT mean you can‚Äôt get into investment banking. Many successful bankers come from schools outside the typical ‚Äútarget‚Äù lists. If you don‚Äôt attend a target school, focus on:\n\nNetworking: Connect with alumni, bankers, and professionals through LinkedIn or career events.\n\nInternships: Gain relevant experience wherever you can, even if it‚Äôs not at a big bank. \n\nSkills: Build your financial and technical skills through courses, certifications, or self-study. \n\nYour hard work and connections can open doors beyond your school‚Äôs reputation.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe label ‚Äútarget school‚Äù is useful to understand how banks recruit, but it‚Äôs not the only factor in landing a great finance job. Focus on gaining skills, making connections, and showing your passion for investment banking. No matter where you study, with dedication, you can reach your career goals.",

    "content": "### By Seri Kanj\n\nIf you're a high school student serious about studying business, you‚Äôve probably come across the names of some well-known undergraduate programs: Wharton, Ross, McCombs, Kelley, Stern. These schools are more than just big names‚Äîthey‚Äôre home to some of the most competitive and prestigious honors business programs in the country.But what exactly are these programs? What makes them different from a typical business major? And how do you know if one of them is right for you?Let‚Äôs break it down.\n\n## What Is an Honors Business Program?\n\nAn honors business program is a selective, often smaller track within a larger business school. These programs are designed for highly motivated students who want a more rigorous, hands-on, and focused academic experience. In most cases, students need to apply separately, either when applying to the university or after their first year.Honors programs typically offer smaller class sizes, priority course registration, leadership training, mentorship from faculty and alumni, exclusive networking events, and more challenging coursework. Many also include honors seminars, capstone projects, or research opportunities.For business-minded students aiming for top internships or competitive graduate programs, these programs can provide a powerful head start.\n\n## Spotlight on Top Honors Programs\n\n### Wharton School (University of Pennsylvania)\n\nWharton is consistently ranked among the best undergraduate business schools in the world. Unlike many universities, Wharton allows students to dive into core business classes starting freshman year. You‚Äôll get access to world-class faculty, cutting-edge research, and a vast alumni network that includes Fortune 500 CEOs and founders. The environment is fast-paced and competitive, but it‚Äôs unmatched in terms of prestige and career opportunities.\n\n### Ross School of Business (University of Michigan)\n\nRoss offers a unique \"action-based learning\" approach, where students solve real business problems for actual companies. It‚Äôs known for its BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) program, and while it isn‚Äôt branded as an ‚Äúhonors‚Äù program, it‚Äôs incredibly selective and well-structured. Ross students often participate in investment funds, consulting clubs, and leadership development programs, giving them real-world experience by sophomore year.\n\n### McCombs School of Business (University of Texas at Austin)\n\nMcCombs is home to the Canfield Business Honors Program (CBHP)‚Äîa true honors track for high-achieving business students. CBHP combines a liberal arts foundation with rigorous business courses, case-based learning, and small class sizes. It‚Äôs well-known for its supportive community and impressive placement rates at top firms like Deloitte, Bain, and Goldman Sachs.\n\n### Kelley School of Business (Indiana University)\n\nKelley‚Äôs Business Honors Program emphasizes collaboration, global awareness, and leadership. Students take specialized honors courses, receive personalized academic advising, and participate in international study opportunities. Kelley also offers one of the best undergraduate career services centers in the country, which helps explain its strong job placement record.\n\n## Is It Worth Applying?\n\nIf you‚Äôre driven, curious, and already interested in business, then yes‚Äîthese programs can open doors. You‚Äôll be surrounded by equally motivated peers, have access to competitive internships, and be better positioned for jobs or grad school after college.However, these programs aren‚Äôt the only path to success. You don‚Äôt _need_ to be in an honors track to build a great career in finance, entrepreneurship, or consulting. What matters most is how you use the resources around you‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through clubs, internships, networking, or your own initiative.\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\nHonors business programs offer an incredible launchpad for high-achieving students, but they‚Äôre not the only way to succeed. Take time to research each program's values, strengths, and culture to see if it aligns with your goals. Whether you're at Wharton or a smaller state school, your curiosity, work ethic, and mindset will ultimately shape your future more than any program name.Choose the program that challenges and excites you‚Äîand then make the most of every opportunity it gives you.",

    "content": "### By Seri Kanj\n\nAs a high school student considering a career in finance, one of the biggest choices you‚Äôll face is whether to attend a public or private university. While both types of schools can offer a strong education, they often differ in terms of cost, class size, resources, and career opportunities. So how do you choose what‚Äôs best for you?\n\nLet‚Äôs break down the pros and cons of each, especially from the perspective of a future finance major.\n\n## **Public Universities: Affordable and Accessible**\n\nPublic universities are funded in part by state governments, which is why they tend to be more affordable, especially for in-state students. If you're hoping to avoid large student loans, public schools can be a smart financial choice. Lower tuition doesn't necessarily mean lower quality. Many public universities have excellent business and finance programs, like the University of Michigan (Ross), Indiana University (Kelley), and the University of Texas at Austin (McCombs).Another major benefit of public schools is their size. Larger student populations mean a wider variety of clubs, student organizations, and networking opportunities. You may also have access to more course offerings, double majors, or interdisciplinary programs. However, because of their size, public universities can also feel less personal. It might be harder to build relationships with professors or get one-on-one support unless you actively seek it out.\n\n## **Private Universities: Personalized and Prestigious**\n\nPrivate universities, on the other hand, are funded through tuition and private donations. This usually means higher sticker prices, but also more generous financial aid, especially if the school is well-endowed. For some students, attending a private university can actually cost the same (or even less) than a public one, depending on the aid package.Private schools often offer smaller class sizes, which means more direct interaction with professors and a closer-knit campus community. This can be a huge advantage if you‚Äôre looking for mentorship or opportunities to do research or special projects. Many private universities also have strong alumni networks and name recognition, which can help when applying for internships or jobs at top finance firms.However, not all private universities are created equal. Just because a school is private doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs automatically better. Be sure to look at the strength of its finance or business program, as well as how well it places students in internships and careers.\n\n## **What Should Finance Students Consider?**\n\nWhen it comes to studying finance, the quality of the program, internship access, and alumni support matter just as much as the name of the school. Public schools with strong business schools often have direct pipelines into Wall Street and major corporations. On the other hand, private schools might offer a more tailored educational experience and stronger personal networks.You should also think about location. Schools in or near major financial hubs (like New York, Chicago, or San Francisco) often give students easier access to internships, events, and networking opportunities, regardless of whether they‚Äôre public or private.\n\n## **Final Takeaway**\n\nThere‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer.

    "content": "## By Dimitre Tobok\n\nWhen high school students think about studying business in college, the Ivy League often comes to mind. Schools like Harvard, UPenn (home of the Wharton School), and Cornell have prestigious reputations, powerful alumni networks, and strong business programs. But are Ivy League schools _really_ the best choice for business majors? And how do they compare to top non-Ivy universities?\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down.\n\n\n## **The Ivy League Advantage**\n\nThere‚Äôs no denying that Ivy League schools open doors. Their name alone carries weight in job interviews and networking events. They offer access to some of the best professors, internship opportunities, and resources in the world. For business majors, this can mean summer internships at top consulting firms, guest lectures by CEOs, and recruitment pipelines to places like Goldman Sachs or McKinsey.\n\nUPenn‚Äôs Wharton School, for example, is considered one of the top undergraduate business programs globally. Harvard and Columbia also offer strong economics and management tracks, with plenty of flexibility to explore entrepreneurship, finance, or international business.\n\nBut‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a catch.\n\n\n## **The Hidden Strength of Non-Ivy Schools**\n\nMany non-Ivy schools offer exceptional business programs, sometimes even better tailored to undergraduates. Schools like the University of Michigan (Ross), NYU (Stern), UC Berkeley (Haas), MIT (Sloan), and the University of Virginia (McIntire) are just a few examples. These schools often provide hands-on, business-specific education from day one, whereas some Ivy programs focus more on liberal arts for the first two years.\n\nPlus, non-Ivies can be more affordable, especially with scholarships or in-state tuition. Smaller class sizes, specialized programs, and a strong focus on practical skills are often emphasized. In fact, many Fortune 500 CEOs and successful entrepreneurs are graduates of non-Ivy schools.\n\n\n## **What Really Matters**\n\nAt the end of the day, your college‚Äôs name can help, but it won‚Äôt define your success. What really matters is **how you use the opportunities you‚Äôre given**: the internships you pursue, the professors you connect with, the leadership roles you take on, and how much effort you put into growing your skills and network.\n\nA student at a non-Ivy school who‚Äôs deeply involved, curious, and proactive can easily outperform someone coasting through an Ivy League degree.\n\n\n## **Final Takeaway**\n\nThere‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer. Ivy Leagues come with prestige, but many non-Ivies offer just as much (if not more) in terms of practical business education and affordability. Instead of chasing a name, focus on finding a school where **you** can thrive, grow, and take charge of your future.\n\nAfter all, your mindset, not just your school, makes the difference.",

    "content": "### By Seri Kanj\n\nIf you‚Äôre considering a future in business, choosing the right college is only part of the equation. Equally important is understanding what kind of education you‚Äôll actually receive once you get there. A strong business school curriculum can shape your skills, mindset, and opportunities, not just for college, but for your entire career.\n\nWhether you're aiming for an Ivy League university or a top non-Ivy program, here's what you should look for in a business curriculum that truly prepares you for the real world.\n\n## **1. A Well-Rounded Core Curriculum**\n\nThe best business programs begin with a solid foundation. This typically means required courses in areas such as finance, accounting, marketing, economics, operations, and management. These core classes introduce you to how different parts of a business work together and help you develop a big-picture understanding of the field.You might not love every subject equally, and that‚Äôs okay. The point is to build a strong base of knowledge across disciplines so you can later specialize in the area that suits your interests and career goals. A curriculum that introduces these topics early (often in the first or second year) gives you more time to explore, reflect, and choose your direction with confidence.\n\n## **2. Real-World Application and Experiential Learning**\n\nBusiness isn‚Äôt just about theory, it's about action. A strong curriculum should connect classroom learning with real-world situations. This can include case studies based on actual companies, simulations of business challenges, and group projects that require critical thinking and collaboration.Some programs go even further by offering hands-on opportunities such as internships, co-op programs, entrepreneurship incubators, or consulting projects with local businesses. These experiences teach you how to problem-solve, lead teams, and communicate ideas effectively, skills that matter just as much as academic performance.Programs that include experiential learning throughout the four years, not just as optional extras, tend to better prepare students for the workforce.\n\n## **3. Flexibility and Specialization Options**\n\nBusiness is a broad field, and no two students follow the same path. Some may be interested in launching a startup, while others are drawn to investment banking, marketing, or analytics. That‚Äôs why a good curriculum should offer flexibility through electives and concentrations.Specializations such as entrepreneurship, international business, business analytics, sustainability, or supply chain management allow students to tailor their education to their career goals. The ability to choose from a wide range of electives or pursue a double major or minor, such as combining business with computer science, economics, or psychology, can also make your education more dynamic and valuable.When comparing schools, look closely at the course catalog and see whether the program allows you to explore your interests in depth.\n\n## **4. Supportive Faculty and Career Guidance**\n\nStrong academics are important, but so is support. Great business schools invest in helping their students succeed, not only in classes but in career planning as well.Faculty who bring real-world experience into the classroom can make learning more relevant and engaging. Programs that offer mentoring, networking events, or guest speakers from the business world provide exposure to different industries and career paths.In addition, look for schools that provide dedicated career services for business students. These offices often host workshops, r√©sum√© reviews, interview coaching, and job fairs tailored to your major. A strong alumni network can also play a big role in helping you land internships or jobs through referrals and connections.\n\n## **5. Global Perspective and Ethical Focus**\n\nToday‚Äôs business world is more connected than ever. A strong curriculum should help you understand global markets, cultural differences, and international trade. Programs that offer study abroad options, global business courses, or international internships can give you an edge in understanding how business operates across borders.It‚Äôs also important that the curriculum includes an emphasis on ethics, social responsibility, and sustainability. Future business leaders need to think critically about the impact of their decisions, not just on profits, but on people and the planet.\n\n## **Final Takeaway**\n\nA strong business school curriculum isn‚Äôt just about what looks good on paper‚Äîit‚Äôs about what prepares you to think, adapt, and lead in the real world. Look beyond flashy rankings and ask deeper questions: What will I learn? How will I apply it? Who will guide me? And will I graduate with not just knowledge, but experience and confidence?Choosing the right program is a personal decision, but by focusing on the quality and structure of the curriculum, you‚Äôll be one step closer to building a future that‚Äôs both successful and meaningful.",

    "content": "## By Fadi Kazak\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was one of the biggest economic disasters in recent history. It changed the way the world sees money, banks, and global markets. This crisis wasn‚Äôt caused by one single mistake. Instead, it happened because of many problems building up over time. To understand what happened, we need to look at how banks, people, and governments made risky choices.\n\n## **The Start**\n\nIn the early 2000s, buying a house in the United States became very popular. Interest rates were low, and banks were giving out home loans easily. Many people saw owning a house as a safe way to build wealth. Banks started giving out ‚Äúsubprime‚Äù loans to people with bad credit. These loans often didn‚Äôt check if people could actually afford to pay them back. At first, the monthly payments were low, so people thought they could manage.\n\nAs more people bought homes, prices went up. This made even more people want to buy houses, hoping to sell them later at a profit. Banks kept handing out loans to keep up with the demand, even though many of them were risky. This created a housing bubble (when prices rise too high compared to the real value).\n\n## **Trouble Begins**\n\nBy 2006, things started to go wrong. Interest rates went up, and many people who had variable-rate mortgages saw their payments jump. A lot of them couldn‚Äôt afford the new higher payments and stopped paying. This led to many home foreclosures.\n\nWith so many homes for sale, prices dropped. The housing bubble burst. Banks had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities (financial products tied to home loans). As more people defaulted, those investments lost value. Some banks lost billions. Big firms like Lehman Brothers couldn‚Äôt survive and went bankrupt. That made the crisis much worse.\n\n## **Global Panic**\n\nWhen Lehman Brothers collapsed, panic spread around the world. Banks became scared to lend to each other because they didn‚Äôt know who might go under next. Credit froze, meaning it was hard for companies and people to borrow money. Some major firms, like AIG and Bear Stearns, needed government help to stay in business.\n\nStock markets crashed, and millions of people lost their jobs. Many families lost their homes and savings. Businesses closed, and the world fell into a deep recession. The crisis revealed serious weaknesses in the financial system, like poor oversight and risky behavior by banks.\n\n## **What Governments Did**\n\nGovernments stepped in to stop things from getting even worse. In the U.S., the government created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This allowed the government to buy bad loans from banks to help them stay open. The Federal Reserve also lowered interest rates and used other tools to keep money flowing.\n\nThese moves helped stop a complete collapse. But they also raised big questions. Was it fair to rescue big companies that made bad choices? Some said this could encourage more risky behavior in the future.\n\nThe crisis caused long-term damage. Many people stayed unemployed for a long time, and trust in banks and governments dropped. In response, the U.S. passed new rules like the Dodd-Frank Act to better control banks and protect consumers. Some of these rules worked, but there‚Äôs still debate over whether they go far enough.\n\n## **Why It Still Matters**\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis showed how problems in one part of the world can quickly spread everywhere. It changed how we think about financial risk, responsibility, and the need for good rules. Learning from this event can help us avoid making the same mistakes again and build a fairer and safer financial system for the future.",

    "content": "## By Asal Rouhani\n\nHave you ever added random stuff to your cart just because you were bored, stressed, or saw someone else with it on TikTok? You‚Äôre not the only one, or ‚Äúbad with money‚Äù. You‚Äôre human.\n\nSpending isn‚Äôt just about money. It‚Äôs emotional, psychological, and honestly, very sneaky. There‚Äôs a reason we buy things we never use and feel guilty after. Let‚Äôs break it down together:\n\n## **1. Emotions**\n\nWe buy things when we‚Äôre happy, sad, bored, stressed, or tired. That‚Äôs because shopping can give our brain a tiny dopamine boost:¬† a ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù hit. But like junk food, the feeling is very short.\n\nSo we keep buying. And the cycle repeats.\n\n_Real tip:_ Next time you want to shop, pause. Ask yourself: _Do I really want this, or am I just feeling something?_\n\n## **2. Brands Know Exactly How to Trick Us**\n\nYep. The \"only 3 left!\" message, the influencer with the perfect skincare routine, the ‚Äúlimited time deal‚Äù.¬† All of it is _intentional_. You didn‚Äôt _accidentally_ want that thing. You were marketed into needing it.\n\n_Real tip:_ Unfollow any brand or person who constantly makes you feel like you need to buy something to be enough. And remember: if it wasn‚Äôt on your wishlist before the sale, it‚Äôs not a real ‚Äúdeal.‚Äù\n\n\n## **3. The ‚ÄòI Deserve This‚Äô Excuse**\n\nYou studied hard. You had a bad day. You nailed your presentation. So you think: _I deserve a treat._\n\nYou do deserve to feel good, but treats don‚Äôt always need to come with a price tag.\n\n_Real tip:_ Make a list of non-shopping rewards, like bubble baths, movie nights, journaling, or just lying on your bed doing nothing (yes, that counts).\n\n## **4. Social Media Makes Us Feel Behind**\n\nSeeing a new phone, outfit, or trip can make you feel like you _need_ to keep up.\\\nBut Instagram isn‚Äôt real life. People show off the highlights, not their credit card debt or stress behind the scenes.\n\n_Real tip:_ Practice gratitude. Write down 3 things you love about your life right now. Seriously. It sounds cheesy, but it rewires your brain over time.\n\n\n## **5. We Don‚Äôt Track, So We Overspend**\n\nIt‚Äôs about the little things: the extra iced latte, the random app subscription, that one-night online order. On their own, they don‚Äôt seem like much. But together? They have a massive impact.\n\n_Real tip:_ Start tracking what you spend for _one week_. Just write it down in your Notes app. You‚Äôll be surprised how much awareness alone changes everything.\n\n\n## **Final Thoughts: You‚Äôre Not ‚ÄúBad With Money.‚Äù You‚Äôre Just Learning.**\n\nNobody‚Äôs perfect. We all mess up sometimes. But the fact that you‚Äôre even reading this means you _care_, and that‚Äôs the first step to taking action. You don‚Äôt need to stop buying things altogether. You just need to start buying with _intention_, not emotion. Your money should work _for_ you, not control you.\n\nSo next time you feel like buying something ‚Äújust because,‚Äù pause. Take a breath. Ask yourself:\n\n_Do I really need this, or are my emotions telling me something else?_",

    "content": "## By Dongwook Han\n\nFew economic forces impact our daily lives more directly than inflation and deflation. From the cost of groceries to the price of housing, changes in price levels affect how far our money goes, and they shape the direction of the economy itself. But what exactly are inflation and deflation and why do they matter?\n\n## **What is Inflation?**\n\nInflation refers to the rise in prices of goods and services over time. This means that a dollar today will likely buy less in the future than it does now. For consumers, this feels like everything is getting more costly and that‚Äôs because it is.¬†¬†\n\nEconomists often see moderate inflation as a sign of a growing economy. When businesses expand and people spend more, prices naturally increase. However, when inflation becomes too high like it has been seen in recent years with global supply chain disruptions and surging energy costs, it begins to erode purchasing power and strain household budgets.¬†\n\nCommon causes of inflation include increased consumer demand, higher production costs (such as wages and materials), and an increase in the money supply. Central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, monitor inflation closely. Their goal is to keep it stable. Being stable is usually 2% annually to maintain a healthy balance between growth and affordability.\n\n## **What is Deflation?**\n\nDeflation is the opposite of inflation. It refers to a general decrease in prices across the economy. At first glance, this might sound like good news. After all, who wouldn‚Äôt want lower prices? However, in reality, deflation can be a warning sign of economic trouble.¬† When prices fall, businesses earn less revenue. This often results in pay cuts, layoffs, and even company shutdowns. Consumers may also delay purchases, expecting prices to drop further, which causes economic activity to slow down even more.¬†¬†\n\nDeflation usually happens during periods of economic crisis or downturn. For example, it was a major issue during the Great Depression in the 1930s and again during Japan‚Äôs ‚ÄúLost Decade‚Äù in the 1990s.\n\n## **How Are They Connected?**\n\nInflation and deflation are closely related and represent opposite movements in price levels. Both are tied to the balance between supply and demand in the economy. When demand rises faster than supply, prices go up, leading to inflation. When demand falls or supply becomes too high, prices decrease, leading to deflation.¬†¬†\n\nGovernments and central banks work to avoid both extremes. They may raise interest rates to reduce inflation or lower them to fight deflation. Fiscal tools, such as changes in government spending or taxes, can also influence inflation and deflation.¬†¬†\n\nKeeping prices stable is crucial for long term economic growth. If inflation or deflation gets too strong, it becomes difficult for businesses to plan, for workers to earn consistently, and for people to spend confidently.\n\n## **Why Prices Change, What It Means for You, and Its Impact on the Economy**\n\nPeople may think that changes in prices are like a small part of the economy, but they have a wide impact. High inflation can reduce the value of savings and create uncertainty. Deflation, on the other hand, can lead to fewer jobs and less income for workers or laborers.¬†¬†\n\nOn a national scale, inflation and deflation directly affect Gross Domestic Product(GDP). which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in a country. As a result, If inflation rises too quickly, the economy can overheat. If deflation takes hold, the economy can shrink.¬†¬†\n\nTo put simply, inflation and deflation affect your daily life and overall direction of the country‚Äôs economy. Understanding these forces helps people to make better financial choices, keeps leaders accountable, and prepares us for what may come in the future.",

    "content": "## By John Jean Hanna\n\nInvesting in property is something many adults talk about, and for good reason. Real estate can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time, but like any investment, it comes with both risks and rewards. As high school students looking ahead to your financial futures, it‚Äôs important to understand the basics. In this article, I‚Äôll break down what real estate investing really means, what makes it appealing, and what you should watch out for.\n\n## **What is Real Estate Investment?** \nReal estate investment means buying property; like a house, apartment, or land, with the goal of making money from it. This can happen in two main ways:\n\n1. **Rental income**: You earn money by renting the property to someone else.\n\n2. **Property value increase (appreciation)**: You buy a property and sell it later for more than you paid.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about buying a place to live, it‚Äôs about using property as a tool to grow your financial future.\n\n## **Key Points about Real Estate Investing:**\n\nReal estate investing involves buying physical property to generate income and build wealth. Investors can earn monthly rent, providing steady cash flow, while properties often increase in value over time. This combination makes real estate a popular long-term wealth-building strategy.\n\n## **Why Do People Invest in Property?**\n\nPeople invest in real estate for several key reasons. One major benefit is steady income, as monthly rent can provide reliable cash flow. Over time, property values often grow, increasing the overall return on investment. Real estate also offers tax benefits, with opportunities for deductions and breaks that can reduce taxable income. Lastly, it provides a sense of stability, as the real estate market is generally less volatile than stocks, making it an attractive long-term investment option.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcZYbvKOz3KWWZYahVCWeZeqJ9H2XZa-nKw5X3eQTLyVCdG2pa_lVlABhXHwDKOR6VlmB5R73xau-DPKW2DbO8ScDDa1evQPyaaJtYYdOkrM8EnqsQTvzDwnirzTFkK907Mux5eVg?key=WvepuRP4_FqxzKkNmRlPjg)\n\n## **Main Pros and Cons at a Glance**\n\nInvesting in rental property comes with a range of pros and cons across different features. Monthly income is a major advantage, as rental income can provide a steady stream of cash; however, a downside is that renters may not always pay on time. In terms of long-term value, properties usually appreciate over time, but this is not guaranteed‚Äîmarket crashes can significantly reduce property values. Regarding control, owning rental property allows you to manage the asset directly, but this also means it requires your time, effort, and regular maintenance. When it comes to risk level, real estate is generally seen as relatively stable, yet it still carries risk depending on factors like location and market conditions. Lastly, while the entry cost to property investment can lead to wealth-building over time, it comes with high upfront expenses, including the down payment and taxes.\n\n## **Why Does This Matter?** \nUnderstanding real estate early on gives you a head start. It‚Äôs not just for adults with big savings, young people can start learning now, so when the time comes, they know how to make smart decisions. Property can be a great way to grow wealth, but it‚Äôs not magic. It takes research, responsibility, and planning.\n\n## **Tips for Future Real Estate Investors**\n\nBefore diving into real estate, it's important to learn the market by researching different areas and understanding how property prices change over time. Start saving early, as you'll need a down payment and extra funds for maintenance and unexpected costs. Always think long-term, since real estate success often comes from patience rather than quick profits. Finally, don‚Äôt ignore the risks; property values can decrease, and renters may be unreliable, so always plan with caution.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfU_lka1gdviOPmMNIYszBJ0TyXLIt9qK1qcHgTHBS4TzjS6BTziECRxUejIEttb5grGEu7qItYxGAxX_1lS26owmEBjtyJomT0hd3biIvE7NNDSpZWF7DlsEdUZ_u_sxTZW7jCOA?key=WvepuRP4_FqxzKkNmRlPjg)\n\n## **Final Thoughts** \nReal estate can be a smart and powerful investment, especially for those who take the time to understand how it works. While it‚Äôs not a guaranteed path to riches, it offers the potential for long-term financial stability. As a high school student, knowing the basics now prepares you to make smarter, more confident decisions in the future; whether you buy your first home, invest in rental property, or simply understand how the property market works.",

    "content": "## By Dimitri Tobok\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever thought about starting a business, running a fundraiser, or even selling something online, you‚Äôve probably heard the terms revenue and profit. A lot of people confuse them, but they‚Äôre not the same thing. In fact, knowing the difference is one of the most important steps toward becoming financially smart.\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down in a way that actually makes sense.\n\n\n## **What Is Revenue?**\n\nRevenue is the _total amount of money_ a business brings in from selling its products or services. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much it costs to make the product, revenue is just the full amount people paid you. (Selling Price x Quantity sold)\n\nThink of it like this: if you sold 100 t-shirts for $20 each, your revenue would be $2,000. Simple, right? That‚Äôs the money coming _in_.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the catch: _revenue is not profit._\n\n\n## **What Is Profit?**\n\nProfit is what‚Äôs **left over** after you pay all the costs to run your business. That includes everything, materials, advertising, shipping, website fees, and more.\n\nSo, using the t-shirt example again, let‚Äôs say it cost you:\n\n- $1,000 to print the shirts\n\n- $300 on ads\n\n- $100 for shipping and packaging\n\nThat‚Äôs **$1,400 in expenses**.\n\n&#x20;You made $2,000 in revenue, but after subtracting your $1,400 in costs, your **profit** is only **$600**.\n\nIn short: _Revenue is what you make. Profit is what you keep._\n\n## **Why the Difference Matters**\n\nIt‚Äôs super easy to brag about how much you made in sales, but if you spent just as much (or more) than you earned, you‚Äôre not really ahead. You might even be losing money (this is called a loss).¬†\n\nMany businesses fail not because they didn‚Äôt sell enough, but because they didn‚Äôt manage their costs properly. That‚Äôs why _profit tells the real story_ of how healthy or successful a business truly is.\n\nAlso, when investors or partners look at a business, they don‚Äôt just ask how much money it made. They want to know: \"How much are you keeping after all your bills are paid?**\"** That‚Äôs the number that matters.\n\n\n## **Real-Life Example for Teens**\n\nLet‚Äôs say you start selling homemade bracelets at school or online. You charge $5 each and sell 50 of them. That‚Äôs $250 in revenue. ($5 x 50)\n\nBut you spent $100 on beads, $30 on packaging, and $20 on delivery supplies. Your total expenses are $150.\n\nYour profit? Only $100. ($250 - $150)\n\nThat‚Äôs still awesome! But now you understand that the money in your pocket at the end of the day isn‚Äôt the same as your total sales. And that‚Äôs what makes you smarter than most new business owners.\n\n## **Finishing Thoughts**\n\nUnderstanding the difference between revenue and profit isn‚Äôt just for business majors or CEOs, it‚Äôs for anyone who wants to be financially aware. Whether you're starting a side hustle, managing a school project, or just curious about how real businesses work, keep this in mind:¬†\n\n- **Revenue is the big number. Profit is the important one.**\n\n- Once you start thinking this way, you‚Äôll approach money with a sharper, smarter mindset, and that‚Äôs a skill _you‚Äôll_ use for life.",

    "content": "## By Khaled Adib\n\nOne of the most significant decisions university students face is choosing a career path that aligns with both their personal aspirations and their financial needs. For many, this decision involves weighing the pursuit of a dream career against the necessity of financial security. A dream career often represents passion, purpose, and creative fulfillment, while financial security offers stability, predictability, and the resources required to live independently and responsibly. Balancing these two goals is a challenge that requires careful planning, realistic expectations, and a commitment to both self-awareness and financial literacy.\n\n\n## Dream Careers vs. Financial Security\n\nDream careers typically reflect an individual‚Äôs intrinsic motivations and interests. Students may aspire to become artists, writers, social workers, or entrepreneurs, roles that offer meaning and personal satisfaction but may not guarantee a stable or sufficient income, especially in the early stages. In contrast, careers associated with financial security, such as those in engineering, healthcare, or finance, tend to provide consistent salaries, benefits, and clear advancement paths, though they may not always align with one‚Äôs passions. This creates a tension between following a path that inspires and one that ensures economic well-being.\n\n\n## The Value of Passion and Mental Well-being\n\nNonetheless, pursuing passion remains important for long-term career satisfaction and mental health. Research indicates that individuals who are engaged and emotionally invested in their work often demonstrate higher levels of resilience, creativity, and persistence. Over time, these qualities can translate into career growth and success, even in fields that initially offer limited financial rewards. However, it is equally important to acknowledge the reality of financial responsibilities. Without a stable income, individuals may experience chronic stress, limited opportunities for personal development, and reduced freedom to make meaningful life choices.\n\n\n## Practical Strategies for Balancing Both\n\nTo navigate this complex landscape, students can adopt a number of practical strategies. One of the most effective approaches is to begin with a dual-track plan: maintain a stable job that meets financial needs while gradually building experience and credibility in one‚Äôs field of interest. For example, a student passionate about filmmaking may choose to work in digital marketing or content production, acquiring transferable skills while developing independent projects on the side. This approach allows for both professional development and income generation without requiring an immediate or risky leap into uncertain territory.\n\n\n## Financial Literacy as a Tool for Flexibility\n\nAnother important strategy is financial planning. Living below one‚Äôs means, creating a monthly budget, and building an emergency fund can provide the flexibility to take calculated risks when opportunities arise. Learning how to manage expenses and prioritize saving empowers individuals to make career decisions based on goals rather than immediate financial pressure. In addition, investing in education and skill development can increase the marketability of one's passion. For instance, an aspiring writer who learns digital publishing or marketing can reach wider audiences and create alternative income streams, thereby increasing the sustainability of their chosen path.\n\n\n## Setting Goals and Adapting Over Time\n\nSetting realistic short-term and long-term goals is also essential. A clear timeline, such as transitioning to full-time creative work within five years, provides structure and motivation. It is important to regularly assess progress and remain adaptable in the face of changing circumstances. Many successful professionals did not start in their ideal roles but made strategic moves over time to align their work with their passions. A practical example is a graduate who begins in a corporate communications role to build savings and then shifts into nonprofit advocacy or public policy once financially stable.\n\n\n## Conclusion: Integrating Passion with Practicality\n\nUltimately, the choice between a dream career and financial security does not have to be mutually exclusive. With foresight, discipline, and a willingness to adapt, students can design a professional path that honors both their ambitions and their responsibilities. Balancing these two priorities involves trade-offs, but it also opens the door to a more intentional and fulfilling career. By developing strong financial habits and approaching career decisions with both passion and pragmatism, students can position themselves for a future that is both meaningful and secure.",

    "content": "## By Khaled Adib\n\nSovereign debt default is one of the most serious events in global finance. It occurs when a country cannot meet its debt obligations, such as missing payments on bonds or international loans. While corporate defaults go through bankruptcy courts, sovereign default plays out through informal negotiation, global politics, and painful economic adjustment.\n\nThe process is complex and often messy. Creditors want to recover their money. The debtor government wants to regain financial stability and access to international markets. Both sides must navigate legal contracts, economic realities, and political constraints. In this article, we break down the concept of sovereign default, the different forms it can take, and what we can learn from recent cases such as Argentina and Sri Lanka\n\n**What Is a Sovereign Default?**\n\nA sovereign default occurs when a national government fails to pay interest or principal on its debt. Not all missed payments count as defaults. Rating agencies and markets generally recognize three major types:\n\n- **Hard default**: This is a missed payment beyond the contractual grace period (often 30 days). If a bond‚Äôs interest payment is not made on time, this usually triggers an official downgrade to default status.\n\n- **Technical default**: This includes non-payment due to administrative errors, or violations of loan covenants. These are typically minor and may be resolved quickly without triggering full default status.\n\n- **Distressed exchange**: This is when a government offers creditors a new debt contract with significantly worse terms than the original. Even if payments continue under the new terms, rating agencies often consider this a form of default.\n\nCredit ratings like \"Selective Default\" or \"Restricted Default\" often describe cases where only part of a country‚Äôs debt is affected. The legal status depends on the governing law in bond contracts. For instance, most international bonds are issued under New York or English law. These contracts often include Collective Action Clauses (CACs), which allow a supermajority of creditors to approve restructuring terms that bind all bondholders. Still, holdout creditors can try to block restructurings by suing, as in Argentina‚Äôs infamous litigation battles.\n\n\n## **Why Do Countries Default?**\n\nSovereign defaults often follow a familiar pattern. Debt levels rise, investor confidence weakens, and a sudden shock (such as a currency collapse, oil price spike, or recession) makes debt payments unsustainable.\n\nThe economic impact of default is severe. Countries typically face capital flight, high inflation, a banking crisis, and a deep recession. Politically, governments often fall, and social unrest rises. The IMF, World Bank, and regional partners may step in with emergency funding, but often on tough terms.\n\n\n## **Case Study 1: Argentina (2001 and 2020)**\n\n**What happened**: In 2001 Argentina defaulted on about $93 billion in external debt, at the time the largest sovereign default in history. This came after years of recession, a currency peg that drained reserves, and growing fiscal deficits. The government froze bank accounts and abandoned its dollar peg. A collapse followed.\n\n**How the default unfolded**: Argentina suspended payments on its bonds and began a years-long restructuring. It launched debt exchanges in 2005 and 2010, offering deep haircuts. About 93 percent of creditors accepted. However, a small group of holdouts refused and sued in U.S. courts. They won, and in 2014 a judge blocked Argentina from paying any creditors unless holdouts were paid too. This led to a technical re-default until settlements were reached in 2016.\n\n**Aftermath**: Argentina suffered a GDP contraction of 11 percent in 2002. Unemployment and poverty surged. Eventually, growth returned, fueled by high commodity prices. Yet Argentina never fully regained investor confidence. Another default occurred in 2020, when it restructured $65 billion under President Alberto Fern√°ndez.\n\n\n## **Case Study 2: Sri Lanka (2022)**\n\n**What happened**: Sri Lanka suspended foreign debt payments in April 2022, becoming the first Asia-Pacific country to default in the 21st century. This followed a collapse in tourism due to COVID-19, tax cuts that reduced revenue, and a costly fertilizer ban that hurt agriculture. Foreign reserves ran dry, and the government could no longer afford essential imports.\n\n**How the default unfolded**: Sri Lanka missed coupon payments on foreign bonds and quickly began negotiations with the IMF. By March 2023, it had secured a $3 billion program. The government also negotiated restructuring deals with bilateral lenders such as India, China, and Japan, as well as private bondholders.\n\n**Aftermath**: Inflation hit nearly 70 percent, the rupee lost half its value, and daily life was disrupted by fuel and medicine shortages. The president resigned following mass protests. In 2024, the economy began stabilizing with support from international institutions, though full recovery depends on completing the restructuring and restoring investor trust.\n\n\n## **Lessons from Sovereign Defaults**\n\n- **Restructuring is painful**. Economic contraction, inflation, and unemployment almost always follow a default.\n\n- **Legal contracts matter**. The ability of holdouts to sue depends on jurisdiction. CACs reduce the risk of protracted litigation.\n\n- **IMF involvement is key**. Most restructurings are supported by IMF programs. These typically require fiscal reforms, transparency measures, and creditor coordination.\n\n- **Timing matters**. Preemptive restructurings (before cash runs out) are less damaging than messy defaults. Sri Lanka‚Äôs default was relatively orderly compared to Argentina‚Äôs.\n\n- **Recovery takes years**. Regaining market access is not quick. Even after settlements, countries may remain cut off from borrowing or face higher interest rates.\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nSovereign default is not the end of the road, but it is a hard reset. For governments, it tests the limits of political leadership and economic planning. For investors, it underscores the importance of legal protections and risk diversification. Whether caused by poor governance, bad luck, or global shocks, sovereign defaults will continue to shape emerging markets in the years ahead.\n\nUnderstanding how and why they happen is essential for anyone involved in international finance.",

    "content": "## By Seri Kanj\n\nInflation has been a key concern for economies worldwide over the past few years. After the pandemic, inflation surged in many countries due to supply chain disruptions, increased consumer demand, and geopolitical tensions. In 2025, inflation is slowing in some places but remains stubbornly high in others. To keep economies stable and protect purchasing power, central banks are using a mix of strategies to manage this ongoing challenge.\n\n## **The Role of Central Banks**\n\nCentral banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank in the EU, are responsible for keeping inflation under control, usually aiming for a target of around 2 percent. They do this mainly by adjusting interest rates, buying or selling government bonds, and managing the money supply. When inflation gets too high, they usually raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and encourage saving, which slows down spending and helps prices stabilize.\n\n## **The U.S. Federal Reserve: Cautious but Firm**\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in 2022 and continued into 2023 and 2024. By early 2025, inflation has slowed but remains above the Fed‚Äôs target. As a result, the Fed is holding rates steady for now, signaling that it wants to see more consistent progress before cutting rates. This cautious approach is meant to avoid repeating past mistakes, where lowering rates too soon led to inflation coming back.\n\n## **European Central Bank: Balancing Growth and Prices**\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) faces a slightly different challenge. While inflation has eased in countries like Germany and France, energy prices and food costs are still elevated in parts of Europe. The ECB has kept interest rates relatively high but is also looking closely at economic growth, which has been slower than expected. In 2025, the ECB is trying to strike a balance between keeping inflation under control and not pushing the region into recession.\n\n## **Emerging Markets: A Tougher Fight**\n\nCountries like Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa are also battling inflation, but their tools are more limited. Many of these central banks raised interest rates aggressively over the past two years. In 2025, some are starting to lower them slightly, hoping inflation will stay low while supporting growth. However, they must also worry about foreign investors pulling out their money if interest rates fall too much, which could weaken their currencies and drive prices back up.\n\n## **China and Japan: A Different Story**\n\nInterestingly, not every country is dealing with high inflation. In China and Japan, inflation remains quite low. In fact, both countries are more concerned about slow economic growth than rising prices. In response, their central banks are keeping interest rates low and using other tools to boost lending and investment. These economies are focusing on long-term stability rather than fighting inflation.\n\n## **Looking Ahead**\n\nThe global fight against inflation in 2025 is far from over. Central banks are walking a tightrope: if they act too slowly, inflation could stay high and hurt everyday consumers. If they act too aggressively, they could trigger job losses and slower growth. The key is finding the right balance, and that balance looks different in every country.\n\nFor the average person, central bank policies may seem distant or abstract. But they shape the interest rates on our loans, the value of our money, and the stability of our economies. As 2025 unfolds, staying informed about these decisions helps us better understand the world we live in and the forces shaping our financial future.",

    "content": "### By Dimitre Tobok\n\n## **What Is BRICS?**\n\nThe BRICS association, consisting primarily of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has significantly expanded its global influence since its establishment. With the recent inclusion of countries like Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Nigeria, the bloc now represents over half of the world's population and a substantial portion of global GDP when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\n\n## **BRICS' Expanding Economic Footprint**\n\nAs of 2025, the expanded BRICS group accounts for approximately 42.2% of global GDP (PPP) and 54.6% of the world's population. This growth reflects the bloc's increasing appeal to emerging economies seeking alternatives to traditional Western-led financial institutions.([ Just International](https://just-international.org/articles/brics-expands-to-54-6-of-world-population-by-adding-nigeria-africas-most-populous-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))¬†\n\nThe inclusion of resource rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE enhances BRICS' influence over global energy markets. Collectively, the bloc now controls about 44% of global oil reserves, positioning it as a significant player in the global energy landscape.[ TASS](https://tass.com/economy/1664817?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n## **Initiatives Toward Financial Independence**\n\nIn 2015, BRICS established the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member countries and other emerging economies. The NDB aims to address the significant investment gap in infrastructure and to provide emerging economies with a greater voice in the global financial system.[ (BRICS](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nAdditionally, BRICS nations are exploring alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade. While the idea of a unified BRICS currency has been discussed, significant challenges remain due to the diverse economic structures and political systems of member countries. Instead, the bloc is focusing on increasing the use of local currencies in bilateral trade agreements.\n\n\n## **Challenges and Internal Dynamics**\n\nDespite its growing economic clout, BRICS faces internal challenges, including differing political systems and economic priorities among member states. Tensions between China and India, as well as varying levels of development and governance structures, pose obstacles to cohesive policy making.\n\nMoreover, while there are discussions about reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, implementing a unified BRICS currency would require significant political and economic alignment, which remains a complex endeavor.\n\n\n## **Future Outlook**\n\nThe expansion and initiatives of BRICS signify a shift toward a more multipolar global economic order. As the bloc continues to grow and assert its influence, it presents both opportunities and challenges for the existing international financial architecture. Monitoring BRICS' developments will be crucial for understanding the future dynamics of global economic governance. For the global economy, this could mean a rebalancing of power away from traditional Western institutions like the IMF and World Bank, increased use of local currencies in trade, greater influence from emerging economies in setting financial norms, and intensified competition in global markets.\n\n## **MLA CITATIONS**\n\n**BRICS Data ‚Äì Official Site** **\"BRICS Data.\"** _BRICS_, Government of Brazil,[ https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data).

    "content": "## By Sami Chatila.\n\nEveryone in life should understand the differences between credit and debit cards. They are similar in some ways but different in others. They each have their own unique purposes and they both have pros and cons. In this article I will delve into the differences, similarities and everything in between.\n\n\n## **What is a Debit Card?**\n\nThe money on your debit card is directly sourced from your personal bank account. If you complete a transaction with your debit card, the money spent is taken from your account right away or within a couple of days depending on the country you're in or the bank you are a customer of. You can picture it as paying for products or services using money that you don't physically have in your pocket.¬†\n\n**Key points about debit cards:**\n\n- You can only spend the money you already have in your account.\n\n- There‚Äôs usually no interest because you‚Äôre not borrowing money.\n\n- Great for everyday purchases and controlling spending.\n\n- Some debit cards offer rewards or cash back, but not always.\n\n\n## **What is a Credit Card?**\n\nCredit cards are the more popular choice by the population. They allow you to receive a loan from the bank or company that you are a customer of. Depending on your credit score which is determined by many different factors like your ability to pay credit card bills on time, you might receive a higher loan amount or credit card limit. However, these loans are not as amazing as they seem. This is because you must pay back these loans every month or bimonthly along with interest, and if you don't pay on time you will be in debt which can be stressful.\n\n**Key points about credit cards:**\n\n- You can spend money you don‚Äôt currently have, up to a credit limit.\n\n- You‚Äôll receive a bill each month and must pay at least a minimum amount.\n\n- If you pay off your balance in full, you avoid interest charges.\n\n- Can help build your credit history, which is important for things like loans.\n\n- Often offer rewards like points, cash back, or travel miles.\n\n\n## **Why Does This Matter?**\n\nDebit cards allow people to control their spending, without going into debt. However, credit cards can be beneficial as by building your credit score, it can award you with different benefits and perks. However using a credit card carelessly can be a very dangerous task that can put you in severe debt¬†\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd11mJyt6L4B_B0MkZfEc8ZTfDlsuykjwWsZMwXDl6HlW2m5GGAPoAfu6lIoZNCTBNHMcOSB9qcszW-9mQ7D1scC6aPNHl7NbtuH0kwpLVssWH5mpv-bXe7Q1dL_ifJFej2ap0d9g?key=pC5XbuUVL-OF0Wm7eTEg2Q)\n\n\n## **Tips for Smart Use**\n\n* **Debit:** Keep track of your balance to avoid overdraft fees.\n\n* **Credit:** Pay your bill in full each month to avoid interest.\n\n* **Both:** Monitor your statements regularly for errors or fraud.\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nBoth debit and credit cards have their own advantages and disadvantages. Understanding how each one works as a student in highschool is extremely important, as it helps you make smarter money decisions and build a strong financial future right from the start.",

    "content": "## By Dimitre Tobok.\n\nAs a student, managing money can feel overwhelming, especially with tuition, books, food, and the occasional (or frequent) bubble tea splurge. But there‚Äôs one timeless budgeting method that can help anyone, even with a modest income, get a handle on their finances, presenting the ultimate 50/30/20 rule.\n\n\n## **What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?**\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule is a simple yet powerful budgeting technique popularized by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren in her 2005 book _All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan_, co-authored with her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi. The idea is straightforward: divide your after-tax income into three categories‚Äî50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment. As Emirates Islamic explains, this rule is \"an easy, intuitive plan on daily spending and saving towards emergencies\" (\"50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance\").\n\nLet‚Äôs break each category down with a student-friendly perspective.\n\n**50%: Needs, Survive First, Then Thrive**\n\nYour ‚Äúneeds‚Äù are essentials; things you absolutely must pay for to practically stay alive. This includes rent, groceries, transportation, basic utilities, health insurance, and minimum debt payments. As Emirates Islamic puts it, these are ‚Äúmust-have living expenses,‚Äù and if they exceed 50% of your income, ‚Äúit may be time to consider downsizing‚Äù or finding cheaper alternatives.\n\nFor students, this might mean sharing an apartment, using public transportation, or switching from brand-name groceries to more affordable ones. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it‚Äôs practical.\n\n\n **30%: Wants,¬† Life‚Äôs Joyful Extras**\n\nWants are what make life enjoyable but aren‚Äôt necessary for survival. Think of outings with friends, streaming services, eating out, fashion upgrades, or new gadgets.\n\nThe key here is recognizing the difference between wants and needs. As the Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia (KWSP) puts it, this rule ‚Äúis a straightforward way to balance your spending and savings, giving you more control over your finances and a greater sense of security‚Äù (\"The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend\").\n\nThat latte you grab every day? Probably a want, not a need. Being honest with yourself about these categories is half the budgeting battle.\n\n**20%: Savings,¬† Pay Your Future First**\n\nThe final 20% goes toward savings and debt reduction. This might be your emergency fund, a savings account, retirement contributions, or student loan repayments above the minimum.\n\nForbes emphasizes the importance of this category: ‚ÄúThis is all about sacrificing spending in the present to benefit your future self‚Äù (Tepper and Benninger). Whether you‚Äôre saving up for a post-graduation trip or just want a safety cushion, building the habit now sets you up for long-term financial freedom.\n\n\n## **Why It Works, Especially for Students**\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this rule is its simplicity. As Forbes notes, ‚ÄúRather than using a zero-based budget, where you assign a purpose to every dollar of income, the 50/30/20 rule allows you to fudge it‚Äù (Tepper and Benninger). This makes it less intimidating, perfect for students just starting out on their financial journey.\n\nMoreover, Emirates Islamic highlights how this rule ‚Äúcan help you plan ahead, for the medium and long-term,‚Äù offering both flexibility and structure for anyone trying to get their finances in shape.\n\n\n## **Real-Life Example**\n\nLet‚Äôs say you earn AED 3,000 a month from a part-time job or allowance:\n\n- **AED 1,500 (50%)** ‚Äì Needs: rent, transport, groceries, data plan\n\n- **AED 900 (30%)** ‚Äì Wants: shopping, eating out, Netflix\n\n- **AED 600 (20%)** ‚Äì Savings: emergency fund, extra loan payments, future investments\n\nEven small amounts saved monthly can grow significantly over time, especially when placed in a high-interest savings account.\n\n\n## **Final Thoughts: Is It Right for You?**\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. Some students may need to allocate more to needs or cut back drastically on wants. KWSP notes that ‚Äúdepending on your financial situation, this rule can be adjusted to better suit your needs‚Äù (\"The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend\").\n\nStill, if you‚Äôre new to budgeting, this method gives you a strong foundation without drowning you in spreadsheets or complicated apps. It‚Äôs all¬† about balance, ensuring your present lifestyle doesn‚Äôt sabotage your future goals.\n\nSo next time you get paid, pause before spending and try this method. You might just find yourself saving more, and stressing less.\n\n\n## **Works Cited (MLA Format)**\n\nEmirates Islamic. ‚Äú50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance.‚Äù _Emirates Islamic_,[ https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/en/key-information/50-30-20-rule-of-personal-finance](https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/en/key-information/50-30-20-rule-of-personal-finance).
