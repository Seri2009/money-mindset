    "content": "# 🎓 The 50/30/20 Rule Explained for Students\n*by Seri Kanj*\n\nAs a high school student exploring how to manage money better, I kept coming across something called the **50/30/20 rule**. At first, it sounded like one of those adult budgeting things I wouldn’t need until college. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized it’s actually a simple and powerful tool that students like us can start using now.\n\n## What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method that divides your **after-tax income** into three categories:\n\n- **50% Needs**\n- **30% Wants**\n- **20% Savings**\n\nEven if you’re not making a full-time salary, this rule helps build strong money habits with whatever income you do have—whether it’s allowance, tutoring pay, or part-time work.\n\n## How It Works (Student Edition)\n\nLet’s say you earn **$100/month** from babysitting or tutoring. Here's how you'd break it down:\n\n### 🔹 50% — Needs ($50)\nFor students, “needs” could include:\n- School supplies\n- Lunch or snack money\n- Public transportation or gas\n- Phone bill contributions\n\n### 🔹 30% — Wants ($30)\nThis covers non-essentials and fun purchases:\n- Going out with friends\n- Streaming services (Spotify, Netflix)\n- Fashion, gadgets, or accessories\n- Gaming or entertainment\n\n### 🔹 20% — Savings ($20)\nSaving while you’re young creates lifelong habits:\n- Emergency fund\n- College or laptop fund\n- Investing (or just learning about it)\n- Opening a student savings account\n\n## Why It Works\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule gave me a **clear structure**. Instead of spending randomly, I now divide my money purposefully. It helps me enjoy the present while still being responsible about the future.\n\nAs I earn more in the future, this structure will scale with me—whether I’m earning $100 or $1,000 a month.\n\n## How I Got Started\n\nHere’s how I applied the rule:\n- Created a simple Google Sheets tracker\n- Used budgeting apps like *Revolut* or *Spendee*\n- Set short-term savings goals (like $100 for a concert)\n- Reviewed my spending weekly\n\nIt’s not about being perfect—just being consistent and intentional.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule helped me **feel more confident** about managing money. It’s one of those things we aren’t usually taught in school but absolutely should be.\n\nIf you’re a student trying to build smart financial habits, this is a great place to start.\n\n> Let’s be the generation that actually knows how to budget.",

    "content": "# Debit vs. Credit Cards: What’s the Difference?  \n*By Seri Kanj* \n\nWhen I first started learning about personal finance, one of the things I kept hearing about was the difference between **debit cards** and **credit cards**. At first glance, they seem pretty similar—they're both plastic (or digital) cards you can use to pay for things. But once I dug deeper, I realized that understanding how they work—and how they differ—is essential to using them wisely and building good financial habits.\n\n## What Is a Debit Card?\n\nA **debit card** is directly connected to your **bank account**. When you use it to make a purchase, the money is taken out of your account almost instantly. It’s basically like paying with cash, but electronically.\n\nThis means you can only spend money that you already have. If your account balance is $50, you can’t spend more than that—unless your bank allows overdraft, which might lead to fees.\n\nDebit cards are great for everyday use and help keep your spending in check. They're also a safer and more convenient alternative to carrying cash.\n\n## What Is a Credit Card?\n\nA **credit card**, on the other hand, allows you to **borrow money** from the credit card issuer up to a certain limit, called a credit limit. You can use it to make purchases, and then you pay that money back later—ideally at the end of the month.\n\nIf you don’t pay your full balance on time, you’ll start owing **interest**, which can be expensive. But if you pay on time and in full, using a credit card responsibly can help you build a **credit score**, which is important for things like renting an apartment, buying a car, or even applying for a job.\n\nCredit cards also often come with **rewards**, **cashback**, or **fraud protection**, making them attractive for people who know how to use them wisely.\n\n## Key Differences\n\nHere are a few important differences to keep in mind:\n\n- **Source of Funds**: Debit cards use your own money. Credit cards borrow money from the issuer.\n- **Spending Limit**: With a debit card, your limit is your bank account balance. With a credit card, it’s your credit limit set by the bank.\n- **Interest**: Debit cards don’t charge interest. Credit cards can, if you don’t pay on time.\n- **Credit Score Impact**: Debit cards don’t affect your credit score. Credit cards can build or damage your credit depending on how you use them.\n- **Rewards and Perks**: Credit cards often offer rewards and purchase protection. Debit cards usually don’t.\n\n## Which One Should Students Use?\n\nAs students, it’s often a good idea to start with a **debit card**. It helps us learn to manage spending within our limits without the risk of debt. But once we’ve developed strong financial habits, getting a **starter credit card** (like a secured credit card or student card) can be a smart way to begin building a credit history.\n\nThe key is to use credit **responsibly**: only spend what you can afford to pay back in full, and always pay your bills on time.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nUnderstanding the difference between debit and credit cards is a small step that can make a big impact on your financial future. Both tools can be useful—but only if you know how to use them wisely.\n\nWhether you’re buying lunch, paying for books, or saving up for something big, being informed about your financial choices helps you stay in control.\n\n> The earlier we learn, the smarter we spend.",
