    "content": "## By Seri Kanj\n\nInflation has been a key concern for economies worldwide over the past few years. After the pandemic, inflation surged in many countries due to supply chain disruptions, increased consumer demand, and geopolitical tensions. In 2025, inflation is slowing in some places but remains stubbornly high in others. To keep economies stable and protect purchasing power, central banks are using a mix of strategies to manage this ongoing challenge.\n\n## **The Role of Central Banks**\n\nCentral banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank in the EU, are responsible for keeping inflation under control, usually aiming for a target of around 2 percent. They do this mainly by adjusting interest rates, buying or selling government bonds, and managing the money supply. When inflation gets too high, they usually raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and encourage saving, which slows down spending and helps prices stabilize.\n\n## **The U.S. Federal Reserve: Cautious but Firm**\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in 2022 and continued into 2023 and 2024. By early 2025, inflation has slowed but remains above the Fed’s target. As a result, the Fed is holding rates steady for now, signaling that it wants to see more consistent progress before cutting rates. This cautious approach is meant to avoid repeating past mistakes, where lowering rates too soon led to inflation coming back.\n\n## **European Central Bank: Balancing Growth and Prices**\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) faces a slightly different challenge. While inflation has eased in countries like Germany and France, energy prices and food costs are still elevated in parts of Europe. The ECB has kept interest rates relatively high but is also looking closely at economic growth, which has been slower than expected. In 2025, the ECB is trying to strike a balance between keeping inflation under control and not pushing the region into recession.\n\n## **Emerging Markets: A Tougher Fight**\n\nCountries like Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa are also battling inflation, but their tools are more limited. Many of these central banks raised interest rates aggressively over the past two years. In 2025, some are starting to lower them slightly, hoping inflation will stay low while supporting growth. However, they must also worry about foreign investors pulling out their money if interest rates fall too much, which could weaken their currencies and drive prices back up.\n\n## **China and Japan: A Different Story**\n\nInterestingly, not every country is dealing with high inflation. In China and Japan, inflation remains quite low. In fact, both countries are more concerned about slow economic growth than rising prices. In response, their central banks are keeping interest rates low and using other tools to boost lending and investment. These economies are focusing on long-term stability rather than fighting inflation.\n\n## **Looking Ahead**\n\nThe global fight against inflation in 2025 is far from over. Central banks are walking a tightrope: if they act too slowly, inflation could stay high and hurt everyday consumers. If they act too aggressively, they could trigger job losses and slower growth. The key is finding the right balance, and that balance looks different in every country.\n\nFor the average person, central bank policies may seem distant or abstract. But they shape the interest rates on our loans, the value of our money, and the stability of our economies. As 2025 unfolds, staying informed about these decisions helps us better understand the world we live in and the forces shaping our financial future.",

    "content": "### By Dimitre Tobok\n\n## **What Is BRICS?**\n\nThe BRICS association, consisting primarily of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has significantly expanded its global influence since its establishment. With the recent inclusion of countries like Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Nigeria, the bloc now represents over half of the world's population and a substantial portion of global GDP when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\n\n## **BRICS' Expanding Economic Footprint**\n\nAs of 2025, the expanded BRICS group accounts for approximately 42.2% of global GDP (PPP) and 54.6% of the world's population. This growth reflects the bloc's increasing appeal to emerging economies seeking alternatives to traditional Western-led financial institutions.([ Just International](https://just-international.org/articles/brics-expands-to-54-6-of-world-population-by-adding-nigeria-africas-most-populous-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) \n\nThe inclusion of resource rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE enhances BRICS' influence over global energy markets. Collectively, the bloc now controls about 44% of global oil reserves, positioning it as a significant player in the global energy landscape.[ TASS](https://tass.com/economy/1664817?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n## **Initiatives Toward Financial Independence**\n\nIn 2015, BRICS established the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member countries and other emerging economies. The NDB aims to address the significant investment gap in infrastructure and to provide emerging economies with a greater voice in the global financial system.[ (BRICS](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nAdditionally, BRICS nations are exploring alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade. While the idea of a unified BRICS currency has been discussed, significant challenges remain due to the diverse economic structures and political systems of member countries. Instead, the bloc is focusing on increasing the use of local currencies in bilateral trade agreements.\n\n\n## **Challenges and Internal Dynamics**\n\nDespite its growing economic clout, BRICS faces internal challenges, including differing political systems and economic priorities among member states. Tensions between China and India, as well as varying levels of development and governance structures, pose obstacles to cohesive policy making.\n\nMoreover, while there are discussions about reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, implementing a unified BRICS currency would require significant political and economic alignment, which remains a complex endeavor.\n\n\n## **Future Outlook**\n\nThe expansion and initiatives of BRICS signify a shift toward a more multipolar global economic order. As the bloc continues to grow and assert its influence, it presents both opportunities and challenges for the existing international financial architecture. Monitoring BRICS' developments will be crucial for understanding the future dynamics of global economic governance. For the global economy, this could mean a rebalancing of power away from traditional Western institutions like the IMF and World Bank, increased use of local currencies in trade, greater influence from emerging economies in setting financial norms, and intensified competition in global markets.\n\n## **MLA CITATIONS**\n\n**BRICS Data – Official Site** **\"BRICS Data.\"** _BRICS_, Government of Brazil,[ https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data).

    "content": "## By Sami Chatila.\n\nEveryone in life should understand the differences between credit and debit cards. They are similar in some ways but different in others. They each have their own unique purposes and they both have pros and cons. In this article I will delve into the differences, similarities and everything in between.\n\n\n## **What is a Debit Card?**\n\nThe money on your debit card is directly sourced from your personal bank account. If you complete a transaction with your debit card, the money spent is taken from your account right away or within a couple of days depending on the country you're in or the bank you are a customer of. You can picture it as paying for products or services using money that you don't physically have in your pocket. \n\n**Key points about debit cards:**\n\n- You can only spend the money you already have in your account.\n\n- There’s usually no interest because you’re not borrowing money.\n\n- Great for everyday purchases and controlling spending.\n\n- Some debit cards offer rewards or cash back, but not always.\n\n\n## **What is a Credit Card?**\n\nCredit cards are the more popular choice by the population. They allow you to receive a loan from the bank or company that you are a customer of. Depending on your credit score which is determined by many different factors like your ability to pay credit card bills on time, you might receive a higher loan amount or credit card limit. However, these loans are not as amazing as they seem. This is because you must pay back these loans every month or bimonthly along with interest, and if you don't pay on time you will be in debt which can be stressful.\n\n**Key points about credit cards:**\n\n- You can spend money you don’t currently have, up to a credit limit.\n\n- You’ll receive a bill each month and must pay at least a minimum amount.\n\n- If you pay off your balance in full, you avoid interest charges.\n\n- Can help build your credit history, which is important for things like loans.\n\n- Often offer rewards like points, cash back, or travel miles.\n\n\n## **Why Does This Matter?**\n\nDebit cards allow people to control their spending, without going into debt. However, credit cards can be beneficial as by building your credit score, it can award you with different benefits and perks. However using a credit card carelessly can be a very dangerous task that can put you in severe debt \n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd11mJyt6L4B_B0MkZfEc8ZTfDlsuykjwWsZMwXDl6HlW2m5GGAPoAfu6lIoZNCTBNHMcOSB9qcszW-9mQ7D1scC6aPNHl7NbtuH0kwpLVssWH5mpv-bXe7Q1dL_ifJFej2ap0d9g?key=pC5XbuUVL-OF0Wm7eTEg2Q)\n\n\n## **Tips for Smart Use**\n\n* **Debit:** Keep track of your balance to avoid overdraft fees.\n\n* **Credit:** Pay your bill in full each month to avoid interest.\n\n* **Both:** Monitor your statements regularly for errors or fraud.\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nBoth debit and credit cards have their own advantages and disadvantages. Understanding how each one works as a student in highschool is extremely important, as it helps you make smarter money decisions and build a strong financial future right from the start.",

    "content": "## By Dimitre Tobok.\n\nAs a student, managing money can feel overwhelming, especially with tuition, books, food, and the occasional (or frequent) bubble tea splurge. But there’s one timeless budgeting method that can help anyone, even with a modest income, get a handle on their finances, presenting the ultimate 50/30/20 rule.\n\n\n## **What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?**\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule is a simple yet powerful budgeting technique popularized by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren in her 2005 book _All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan_, co-authored with her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi. The idea is straightforward: divide your after-tax income into three categories—50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment. As Emirates Islamic explains, this rule is \"an easy, intuitive plan on daily spending and saving towards emergencies\" (\"50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance\").\n\nLet’s break each category down with a student-friendly perspective.\n\n**50%: Needs, Survive First, Then Thrive**\n\nYour “needs” are essentials; things you absolutely must pay for to practically stay alive. This includes rent, groceries, transportation, basic utilities, health insurance, and minimum debt payments. As Emirates Islamic puts it, these are “must-have living expenses,” and if they exceed 50% of your income, “it may be time to consider downsizing” or finding cheaper alternatives.\n\nFor students, this might mean sharing an apartment, using public transportation, or switching from brand-name groceries to more affordable ones. It’s not glamorous, but it’s practical.\n\n\n **30%: Wants,  Life’s Joyful Extras**\n\nWants are what make life enjoyable but aren’t necessary for survival. Think of outings with friends, streaming services, eating out, fashion upgrades, or new gadgets.\n\nThe key here is recognizing the difference between wants and needs. As the Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia (KWSP) puts it, this rule “is a straightforward way to balance your spending and savings, giving you more control over your finances and a greater sense of security” (\"The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend\").\n\nThat latte you grab every day? Probably a want, not a need. Being honest with yourself about these categories is half the budgeting battle.\n\n**20%: Savings,  Pay Your Future First**\n\nThe final 20% goes toward savings and debt reduction. This might be your emergency fund, a savings account, retirement contributions, or student loan repayments above the minimum.\n\nForbes emphasizes the importance of this category: “This is all about sacrificing spending in the present to benefit your future self” (Tepper and Benninger). Whether you’re saving up for a post-graduation trip or just want a safety cushion, building the habit now sets you up for long-term financial freedom.\n\n\n## **Why It Works, Especially for Students**\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this rule is its simplicity. As Forbes notes, “Rather than using a zero-based budget, where you assign a purpose to every dollar of income, the 50/30/20 rule allows you to fudge it” (Tepper and Benninger). This makes it less intimidating, perfect for students just starting out on their financial journey.\n\nMoreover, Emirates Islamic highlights how this rule “can help you plan ahead, for the medium and long-term,” offering both flexibility and structure for anyone trying to get their finances in shape.\n\n\n## **Real-Life Example**\n\nLet’s say you earn AED 3,000 a month from a part-time job or allowance:\n\n- **AED 1,500 (50%)** – Needs: rent, transport, groceries, data plan\n\n- **AED 900 (30%)** – Wants: shopping, eating out, Netflix\n\n- **AED 600 (20%)** – Savings: emergency fund, extra loan payments, future investments\n\nEven small amounts saved monthly can grow significantly over time, especially when placed in a high-interest savings account.\n\n\n## **Final Thoughts: Is It Right for You?**\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule isn’t one-size-fits-all. Some students may need to allocate more to needs or cut back drastically on wants. KWSP notes that “depending on your financial situation, this rule can be adjusted to better suit your needs” (\"The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend\").\n\nStill, if you’re new to budgeting, this method gives you a strong foundation without drowning you in spreadsheets or complicated apps. It’s all  about balance, ensuring your present lifestyle doesn’t sabotage your future goals.\n\nSo next time you get paid, pause before spending and try this method. You might just find yourself saving more, and stressing less.\n\n\n## **Works Cited (MLA Format)**\n\nEmirates Islamic. “50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance.” _Emirates Islamic_,[ https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/en/key-information/50-30-20-rule-of-personal-finance](https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/en/key-information/50-30-20-rule-of-personal-finance).
