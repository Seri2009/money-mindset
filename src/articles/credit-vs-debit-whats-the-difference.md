## By Sami Chatila.

Everyone in life should understand the differences between credit and debit cards. They are similar in some ways but different in others. They each have their own unique purposes and they both have pros and cons. In this article I will delve into the differences, similarities and everything in between.


## **What is a Debit Card?**

The money on your debit card is directly sourced from your personal bank account. If you complete a transaction with your debit card, the money spent is taken from your account right away or within a couple of days depending on the country you're in or the bank you are a customer of. You can picture it as paying for products or services using money that you don't physically have in your pocket.

**Key points about debit cards:**

- You can only spend the money you already have in your account.

- There’s usually no interest because you’re not borrowing money.

- Great for everyday purchases and controlling spending.

- Some debit cards offer rewards or cash back, but not always.


## **What is a Credit Card?**

Credit cards are the more popular choice by the population. They allow you to receive a loan from the bank or company that you are a customer of. Depending on your credit score which is determined by many different factors like your ability to pay credit card bills on time, you might receive a higher loan amount or credit card limit. However, these loans are not as amazing as they seem. This is because you must pay back these loans every month or bimonthly along with interest, and if you don't pay on time you will be in debt which can be stressful.

**Key points about credit cards:**

- You can spend money you don’t currently have, up to a credit limit.

- You’ll receive a bill each month and must pay at least a minimum amount.

- If you pay off your balance in full, you avoid interest charges.

- Can help build your credit history, which is important for things like loans.

- Often offer rewards like points, cash back, or travel miles.
