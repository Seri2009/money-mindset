## **What Is BRICS?**

The BRICS association, consisting primarily of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has significantly expanded its global influence since its establishment. With the recent inclusion of countries like Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Nigeria, the bloc now represents over half of the world's population and a substantial portion of global GDP when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP).


## **BRICS' Expanding Economic Footprint**

As of 2025, the expanded BRICS group accounts for approximately 42.2% of global GDP (PPP) and 54.6% of the world's population. This growth reflects the bloc's increasing appeal to emerging economies seeking alternatives to traditional Western-led financial institutions.([ Just International](https://just-international.org/articles/brics-expands-to-54-6-of-world-population-by-adding-nigeria-africas-most-populous-country/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) 

The inclusion of resource rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE enhances BRICS' influence over global energy markets. Collectively, the bloc now controls about 44% of global oil reserves, positioning it as a significant player in the global energy landscape.[ TASS](https://tass.com/economy/1664817?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


## **Initiatives Toward Financial Independence**

In 2015, BRICS established the New Development Bank (NDB) to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member countries and other emerging economies. The NDB aims to address the significant investment gap in infrastructure and to provide emerging economies with a greater voice in the global financial system.[ (BRICS](https://brics.br/en/about-the-brics/brics-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Additionally, BRICS nations are exploring alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade. While the idea of a unified BRICS currency has been discussed, significant challenges remain due to the diverse economic structures and political systems of member countries. Instead, the bloc is focusing on increasing the use of local currencies in bilateral trade agreements.


## **Challenges and Internal Dynamics**

Despite its growing economic clout, BRICS faces internal challenges, including differing political systems and economic priorities among member states. Tensions between China and India, as well as varying levels of development and governance structures, pose obstacles to cohesive policy making.

Moreover, while there are discussions about reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, implementing a unified BRICS currency would require significant political and economic alignment, which remains a complex endeavor.


## **Future Outlook**

The expansion and initiatives of BRICS signify a shift toward a more multipolar global economic order. As the bloc continues to grow and assert its influence, it presents both opportunities and challenges for the existing international financial architecture. Monitoring BRICS' developments will be crucial for understanding the future dynamics of global economic governance. For the global economy, this could mean a rebalancing of power away from traditional Western institutions like the IMF and World Bank, increased use of local currencies in trade, greater influence from emerging economies in setting financial norms, and intensified competition in global markets.
