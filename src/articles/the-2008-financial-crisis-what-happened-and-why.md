The 2008 financial crisis was one of the biggest economic disasters in recent history. It changed the way the world sees money, banks, and global markets. This crisis wasn’t caused by one single mistake. Instead, it happened because of many problems building up over time. To understand what happened, we need to look at how banks, people, and governments made risky choices.

## **The Start**

In the early 2000s, buying a house in the United States became very popular. Interest rates were low, and banks were giving out home loans easily. Many people saw owning a house as a safe way to build wealth. Banks started giving out “subprime” loans to people with bad credit. These loans often didn’t check if people could actually afford to pay them back. At first, the monthly payments were low, so people thought they could manage.

As more people bought homes, prices went up. This made even more people want to buy houses, hoping to sell them later at a profit. Banks kept handing out loans to keep up with the demand, even though many of them were risky. This created a housing bubble (when prices rise too high compared to the real value).

## **Trouble Begins**

By 2006, things started to go wrong. Interest rates went up, and many people who had variable-rate mortgages saw their payments jump. A lot of them couldn’t afford the new higher payments and stopped paying. This led to many home foreclosures.

With so many homes for sale, prices dropped. The housing bubble burst. Banks had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities (financial products tied to home loans). As more people defaulted, those investments lost value. Some banks lost billions. Big firms like Lehman Brothers couldn’t survive and went bankrupt. That made the crisis much worse.

## **Global Panic**

When Lehman Brothers collapsed, panic spread around the world. Banks became scared to lend to each other because they didn’t know who might go under next. Credit froze, meaning it was hard for companies and people to borrow money. Some major firms, like AIG and Bear Stearns, needed government help to stay in business.

Stock markets crashed, and millions of people lost their jobs. Many families lost their homes and savings. Businesses closed, and the world fell into a deep recession. The crisis revealed serious weaknesses in the financial system, like poor oversight and risky behavior by banks.

## **What Governments Did**

Governments stepped in to stop things from getting even worse. In the U.S., the government created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This allowed the government to buy bad loans from banks to help them stay open. The Federal Reserve also lowered interest rates and used other tools to keep money flowing.

These moves helped stop a complete collapse. But they also raised big questions. Was it fair to rescue big companies that made bad choices? Some said this could encourage more risky behavior in the future.

The crisis caused long-term damage. Many people stayed unemployed for a long time, and trust in banks and governments dropped. In response, the U.S. passed new rules like the Dodd-Frank Act to better control banks and protect consumers. Some of these rules worked, but there’s still debate over whether they go far enough.

## **Why It Still Matters**

The 2008 financial crisis showed how problems in one part of the world can quickly spread everywhere. It changed how we think about financial risk, responsibility, and the need for good rules. Learning from this event can help us avoid making the same mistakes again and build a fairer and safer financial system for the future.
