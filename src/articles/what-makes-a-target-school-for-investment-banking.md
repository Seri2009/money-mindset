If you’re interested in a career in investment banking, you may have heard the term “target school.” But what exactly does that mean, and why does it matter? Understanding this can help you plan your path and stay motivated, no matter where you study.

## What Is a Target School?

A target school is a college or university where investment banks actively recruit students for internships and full-time jobs. These schools usually have strong finance programs, great reputations, and many alumni working in banking. Because banks visit these campuses regularly, students have easier access to interviews, networking events, and recruiting workshops.

## Why Do Banks Focus on Target Schools?

Investment banks want to hire the best candidates efficiently. Target schools provide a steady stream of talented students who are trained in relevant skills, like financial modeling, economics, and business communication. The banks also benefit from the strong alumni networks at these schools, which helps with referrals and mentoring.

## Examples of Target Schools

Some of the most common target schools for investment banking include: University of Pennsylvania (Wharton), Harvard University, Stanford University, University of Chicago (Booth), and Columbia University.

These schools are often on banks’ official recruiting lists. But keep in mind, this list is not fixed. Some banks recruit from other universities, too.

## What If You’re Not at a Target School?

Here’s the important part: being at a non-target school does NOT mean you can’t get into investment banking. Many successful bankers come from schools outside the typical “target” lists. If you don’t attend a target school, focus on:

Networking: Connect with alumni, bankers, and professionals through LinkedIn or career events.

Internships: Gain relevant experience wherever you can, even if it’s not at a big bank. 

Skills: Build your financial and technical skills through courses, certifications, or self-study. 

Your hard work and connections can open doors beyond your school’s reputation.

## Final Thoughts

The label “target school” is useful to understand how banks recruit, but it’s not the only factor in landing a great finance job. Focus on gaining skills, making connections, and showing your passion for investment banking. No matter where you study, with dedication, you can reach your career goals.
