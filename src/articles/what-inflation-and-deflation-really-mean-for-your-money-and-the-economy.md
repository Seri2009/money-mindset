## By Dongwook Han

Few economic forces impact our daily lives more directly than inflation and deflation. From the cost of groceries to the price of housing, changes in price levels affect how far our money goes, and they shape the direction of the economy itself. But what exactly are inflation and deflation and why do they matter?

## **What is Inflation?**

Inflation refers to the rise in prices of goods and services over time. This means that a dollar today will likely buy less in the future than it does now. For consumers, this feels like everything is getting more costly and that’s because it is.  

Economists often see moderate inflation as a sign of a growing economy. When businesses expand and people spend more, prices naturally increase. However, when inflation becomes too high like it has been seen in recent years with global supply chain disruptions and surging energy costs, it begins to erode purchasing power and strain household budgets. 

Common causes of inflation include increased consumer demand, higher production costs (such as wages and materials), and an increase in the money supply. Central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, monitor inflation closely. Their goal is to keep it stable. Being stable is usually 2% annually to maintain a healthy balance between growth and affordability.

## **What is Deflation?**

Deflation is the opposite of inflation. It refers to a general decrease in prices across the economy. At first glance, this might sound like good news. After all, who wouldn’t want lower prices? However, in reality, deflation can be a warning sign of economic trouble.  When prices fall, businesses earn less revenue. This often results in pay cuts, layoffs, and even company shutdowns. Consumers may also delay purchases, expecting prices to drop further, which causes economic activity to slow down even more.  

Deflation usually happens during periods of economic crisis or downturn. For example, it was a major issue during the Great Depression in the 1930s and again during Japan’s “Lost Decade” in the 1990s.

## **How Are They Connected?**

Inflation and deflation are closely related and represent opposite movements in price levels. Both are tied to the balance between supply and demand in the economy. When demand rises faster than supply, prices go up, leading to inflation. When demand falls or supply becomes too high, prices decrease, leading to deflation.  

Governments and central banks work to avoid both extremes. They may raise interest rates to reduce inflation or lower them to fight deflation. Fiscal tools, such as changes in government spending or taxes, can also influence inflation and deflation.  

Keeping prices stable is crucial for long term economic growth. If inflation or deflation gets too strong, it becomes difficult for businesses to plan, for workers to earn consistently, and for people to spend confidently.

## **Why Prices Change, What It Means for You, and Its Impact on the Economy**

People may think that changes in prices are like a small part of the economy, but they have a wide impact. High inflation can reduce the value of savings and create uncertainty. Deflation, on the other hand, can lead to fewer jobs and less income for workers or laborers.  

On a national scale, inflation and deflation directly affect Gross Domestic Product(GDP). which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in a country. As a result, If inflation rises too quickly, the economy can overheat. If deflation takes hold, the economy can shrink.  

To put simply, inflation and deflation affect your daily life and overall direction of the country’s economy. Understanding these forces helps people to make better financial choices, keeps leaders accountable, and prepares us for what may come in the future.
