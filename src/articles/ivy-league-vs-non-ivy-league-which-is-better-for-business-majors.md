## By Dimitre Tobok

When high school students think about studying business in college, the Ivy League often comes to mind. Schools like Harvard, UPenn (home of the Wharton School), and Cornell have prestigious reputations, powerful alumni networks, and strong business programs. But are Ivy League schools _really_ the best choice for business majors? And how do they compare to top non-Ivy universities?

Let’s break it down.


## **The Ivy League Advantage**

There’s no denying that Ivy League schools open doors. Their name alone carries weight in job interviews and networking events. They offer access to some of the best professors, internship opportunities, and resources in the world. For business majors, this can mean summer internships at top consulting firms, guest lectures by CEOs, and recruitment pipelines to places like Goldman Sachs or McKinsey.

UPenn’s Wharton School, for example, is considered one of the top undergraduate business programs globally. Harvard and Columbia also offer strong economics and management tracks, with plenty of flexibility to explore entrepreneurship, finance, or international business.

But… there’s a catch.


## **The Hidden Strength of Non-Ivy Schools**

Many non-Ivy schools offer exceptional business programs, sometimes even better tailored to undergraduates. Schools like the University of Michigan (Ross), NYU (Stern), UC Berkeley (Haas), MIT (Sloan), and the University of Virginia (McIntire) are just a few examples. These schools often provide hands-on, business-specific education from day one, whereas some Ivy programs focus more on liberal arts for the first two years.

Plus, non-Ivies can be more affordable, especially with scholarships or in-state tuition. Smaller class sizes, specialized programs, and a strong focus on practical skills are often emphasized. In fact, many Fortune 500 CEOs and successful entrepreneurs are graduates of non-Ivy schools.


## **What Really Matters**

At the end of the day, your college’s name can help, but it won’t define your success. What really matters is **how you use the opportunities you’re given**: the internships you pursue, the professors you connect with, the leadership roles you take on, and how much effort you put into growing your skills and network.

A student at a non-Ivy school who’s deeply involved, curious, and proactive can easily outperform someone coasting through an Ivy League degree.


## **Final Takeaway**

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Ivy Leagues come with prestige, but many non-Ivies offer just as much (if not more) in terms of practical business education and affordability. Instead of chasing a name, focus on finding a school where **you** can thrive, grow, and take charge of your future.

After all, your mindset, not just your school, makes the difference.
