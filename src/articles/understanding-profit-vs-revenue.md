## By Dimitri Tobok

If you’ve ever thought about starting a business, running a fundraiser, or even selling something online, you’ve probably heard the terms revenue and profit. A lot of people confuse them, but they’re not the same thing. In fact, knowing the difference is one of the most important steps toward becoming financially smart.

Let’s break it down in a way that actually makes sense.


## **What Is Revenue?**

Revenue is the _total amount of money_ a business brings in from selling its products or services. It doesn’t matter how much it costs to make the product, revenue is just the full amount people paid you. (Selling Price x Quantity sold)

Think of it like this: if you sold 100 t-shirts for $20 each, your revenue would be $2,000. Simple, right? That’s the money coming _in_.

But here’s the catch: _revenue is not profit._


## **What Is Profit?**

Profit is what’s **left over** after you pay all the costs to run your business. That includes everything, materials, advertising, shipping, website fees, and more.

So, using the t-shirt example again, let’s say it cost you:

- $1,000 to print the shirts

- $300 on ads

- $100 for shipping and packaging

That’s **$1,400 in expenses**.

&#x20;You made $2,000 in revenue, but after subtracting your $1,400 in costs, your **profit** is only **$600**.

In short: _Revenue is what you make. Profit is what you keep._

## **Why the Difference Matters**

It’s super easy to brag about how much you made in sales, but if you spent just as much (or more) than you earned, you’re not really ahead. You might even be losing money (this is called a loss). 

Many businesses fail not because they didn’t sell enough, but because they didn’t manage their costs properly. That’s why _profit tells the real story_ of how healthy or successful a business truly is.

Also, when investors or partners look at a business, they don’t just ask how much money it made. They want to know: "How much are you keeping after all your bills are paid?**"** That’s the number that matters.


## **Real-Life Example for Teens**

Let’s say you start selling homemade bracelets at school or online. You charge $5 each and sell 50 of them. That’s $250 in revenue. ($5 x 50)

But you spent $100 on beads, $30 on packaging, and $20 on delivery supplies. Your total expenses are $150.

Your profit? Only $100. ($250 - $150)

That’s still awesome! But now you understand that the money in your pocket at the end of the day isn’t the same as your total sales. And that’s what makes you smarter than most new business owners.

## **Finishing Thoughts**

Understanding the difference between revenue and profit isn’t just for business majors or CEOs, it’s for anyone who wants to be financially aware. Whether you're starting a side hustle, managing a school project, or just curious about how real businesses work, keep this in mind: 

- **Revenue is the big number. Profit is the important one.**

- Once you start thinking this way, you’ll approach money with a sharper, smarter mindset, and that’s a skill _you’ll_ use for life.
