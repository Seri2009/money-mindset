## By Seri Kanj

Inflation has been a key concern for economies worldwide over the past few years. After the pandemic, inflation surged in many countries due to supply chain disruptions, increased consumer demand, and geopolitical tensions. In 2025, inflation is slowing in some places but remains stubbornly high in others. To keep economies stable and protect purchasing power, central banks are using a mix of strategies to manage this ongoing challenge.

## **The Role of Central Banks**

Central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank in the EU, are responsible for keeping inflation under control, usually aiming for a target of around 2 percent. They do this mainly by adjusting interest rates, buying or selling government bonds, and managing the money supply. When inflation gets too high, they usually raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and encourage saving, which slows down spending and helps prices stabilize.

## **The U.S. Federal Reserve: Cautious but Firm**

In the United States, the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in 2022 and continued into 2023 and 2024. By early 2025, inflation has slowed but remains above the Fedâ€™s target. As a result, the Fed is holding rates steady for now, signaling that it wants to see more consistent progress before cutting rates. This cautious approach is meant to avoid repeating past mistakes, where lowering rates too soon led to inflation coming back.

## **European Central Bank: Balancing Growth and Prices**

The European Central Bank (ECB) faces a slightly different challenge. While inflation has eased in countries like Germany and France, energy prices and food costs are still elevated in parts of Europe. The ECB has kept interest rates relatively high but is also looking closely at economic growth, which has been slower than expected. In 2025, the ECB is trying to strike a balance between keeping inflation under control and not pushing the region into recession.

## **Emerging Markets: A Tougher Fight**

Countries like Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa are also battling inflation, but their tools are more limited. Many of these central banks raised interest rates aggressively over the past two years. In 2025, some are starting to lower them slightly, hoping inflation will stay low while supporting growth. However, they must also worry about foreign investors pulling out their money if interest rates fall too much, which could weaken their currencies and drive prices back up.

## **China and Japan: A Different Story**

Interestingly, not every country is dealing with high inflation. In China and Japan, inflation remains quite low. In fact, both countries are more concerned about slow economic growth than rising prices. In response, their central banks are keeping interest rates low and using other tools to boost lending and investment. These economies are focusing on long-term stability rather than fighting inflation.

## **Looking Ahead**

The global fight against inflation in 2025 is far from over. Central banks are walking a tightrope: if they act too slowly, inflation could stay high and hurt everyday consumers. If they act too aggressively, they could trigger job losses and slower growth. The key is finding the right balance, and that balance looks different in every country.

For the average person, central bank policies may seem distant or abstract. But they shape the interest rates on our loans, the value of our money, and the stability of our economies. As 2025 unfolds, staying informed about these decisions helps us better understand the world we live in and the forces shaping our financial future.
