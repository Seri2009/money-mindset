## By Dimitre Tobok.

As a student, managing money can feel overwhelming, especially with tuition, books, food, and the occasional (or frequent) bubble tea splurge. But there’s one timeless budgeting method that can help anyone, even with a modest income, get a handle on their finances, presenting the ultimate 50/30/20 rule.


## **What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?**

The 50/30/20 rule is a simple yet powerful budgeting technique popularized by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren in her 2005 book _All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan_, co-authored with her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi. The idea is straightforward: divide your after-tax income into three categories—50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment. As Emirates Islamic explains, this rule is "an easy, intuitive plan on daily spending and saving towards emergencies" ("50-30-20 Rule of Personal Finance").

Let’s break each category down with a student-friendly perspective.

**50%: Needs, Survive First, Then Thrive**

Your “needs” are essentials; things you absolutely must pay for to practically stay alive. This includes rent, groceries, transportation, basic utilities, health insurance, and minimum debt payments. As Emirates Islamic puts it, these are “must-have living expenses,” and if they exceed 50% of your income, “it may be time to consider downsizing” or finding cheaper alternatives.

For students, this might mean sharing an apartment, using public transportation, or switching from brand-name groceries to more affordable ones. It’s not glamorous, but it’s practical.


 **30%: Wants,  Life’s Joyful Extras**

Wants are what make life enjoyable but aren’t necessary for survival. Think of outings with friends, streaming services, eating out, fashion upgrades, or new gadgets.

The key here is recognizing the difference between wants and needs. As the Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia (KWSP) puts it, this rule “is a straightforward way to balance your spending and savings, giving you more control over your finances and a greater sense of security” ("The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend").

That latte you grab every day? Probably a want, not a need. Being honest with yourself about these categories is half the budgeting battle.

**20%: Savings,  Pay Your Future First**

The final 20% goes toward savings and debt reduction. This might be your emergency fund, a savings account, retirement contributions, or student loan repayments above the minimum.

Forbes emphasizes the importance of this category: “This is all about sacrificing spending in the present to benefit your future self” (Tepper and Benninger). Whether you’re saving up for a post-graduation trip or just want a safety cushion, building the habit now sets you up for long-term financial freedom.


## **Why It Works, Especially for Students**

One of the greatest strengths of this rule is its simplicity. As Forbes notes, “Rather than using a zero-based budget, where you assign a purpose to every dollar of income, the 50/30/20 rule allows you to fudge it” (Tepper and Benninger). This makes it less intimidating, perfect for students just starting out on their financial journey.

Moreover, Emirates Islamic highlights how this rule “can help you plan ahead, for the medium and long-term,” offering both flexibility and structure for anyone trying to get their finances in shape.


## **Real-Life Example**

Let’s say you earn AED 3,000 a month from a part-time job or allowance:

- **AED 1,500 (50%)** – Needs: rent, transport, groceries, data plan

- **AED 900 (30%)** – Wants: shopping, eating out, Netflix

- **AED 600 (20%)** – Savings: emergency fund, extra loan payments, future investments

Even small amounts saved monthly can grow significantly over time, especially when placed in a high-interest savings account.


## **Final Thoughts: Is It Right for You?**

The 50/30/20 rule isn’t one-size-fits-all. Some students may need to allocate more to needs or cut back drastically on wants. KWSP notes that “depending on your financial situation, this rule can be adjusted to better suit your needs” ("The 50/30/20 Rule: Your Budgeting Best Friend").

Still, if you’re new to budgeting, this method gives you a strong foundation without drowning you in spreadsheets or complicated apps. It’s all  about balance, ensuring your present lifestyle doesn’t sabotage your future goals.

So next time you get paid, pause before spending and try this method. You might just find yourself saving more, and stressing less.
