## By Asal Rouhani

Have you ever added random stuff to your cart just because you were bored, stressed, or saw someone else with it on TikTok? You’re not the only one, or “bad with money”. You’re human.

Spending isn’t just about money. It’s emotional, psychological, and honestly, very sneaky. There’s a reason we buy things we never use and feel guilty after. Let’s break it down together:

## **1. Emotions**

We buy things when we’re happy, sad, bored, stressed, or tired. That’s because shopping can give our brain a tiny dopamine boost:  a “feel good” hit. But like junk food, the feeling is very short.

So we keep buying. And the cycle repeats.

_Real tip:_ Next time you want to shop, pause. Ask yourself: _Do I really want this, or am I just feeling something?_

## **2. Brands Know Exactly How to Trick Us**

Yep. The "only 3 left!" message, the influencer with the perfect skincare routine, the “limited time deal”.  All of it is _intentional_. You didn’t _accidentally_ want that thing. You were marketed into needing it.

_Real tip:_ Unfollow any brand or person who constantly makes you feel like you need to buy something to be enough. And remember: if it wasn’t on your wishlist before the sale, it’s not a real “deal.”


## **3. The ‘I Deserve This’ Excuse**

You studied hard. You had a bad day. You nailed your presentation. So you think: _I deserve a treat._

You do deserve to feel good, but treats don’t always need to come with a price tag.

_Real tip:_ Make a list of non-shopping rewards, like bubble baths, movie nights, journaling, or just lying on your bed doing nothing (yes, that counts).

## **4. Social Media Makes Us Feel Behind**

Seeing a new phone, outfit, or trip can make you feel like you _need_ to keep up.\
But Instagram isn’t real life. People show off the highlights, not their credit card debt or stress behind the scenes.

_Real tip:_ Practice gratitude. Write down 3 things you love about your life right now. Seriously. It sounds cheesy, but it rewires your brain over time.


## **5. We Don’t Track, So We Overspend**

It’s about the little things: the extra iced latte, the random app subscription, that one-night online order. On their own, they don’t seem like much. But together? They have a massive impact.

_Real tip:_ Start tracking what you spend for _one week_. Just write it down in your Notes app. You’ll be surprised how much awareness alone changes everything.


## **Final Thoughts: You’re Not “Bad With Money.” You’re Just Learning.**

Nobody’s perfect. We all mess up sometimes. But the fact that you’re even reading this means you _care_, and that’s the first step to taking action. You don’t need to stop buying things altogether. You just need to start buying with _intention_, not emotion. Your money should work _for_ you, not control you.

So next time you feel like buying something “just because,” pause. Take a breath. Ask yourself:

_Do I really need this, or are my emotions telling me something else?_
