## By Dimitri Tobok

If you’re a teen who has ever thought, “I want to make my money work for me,” you’re already ahead of the game. Investing isn’t something that’s reserved for Wall Street pros or college business majors. It’s for anyone who’s curious, motivated, and determined to learn how money really works. And the best time to start is now, when you're young and pure.  

Sure, TikTok videos and quick YouTube video explainers can offer bite-sized advice, but there’s something uniquely valuable about diving into a book. Books give you more than surface-level tips. They explain the reasons behind financial strategies, teach real-world application, and help you build a mindset that lasts a lifetime.

 Below is a handpicked list of the top 6 investing books that are beginner-friendly, teen-appropriate, and, believe it or not, actually enjoyable to read. Whether you're just getting started or looking to expand your financial knowledge, these books will guide you every step of the way.


##  **1. _Rich Dad Poor Dad_ by Robert T. Kiyosaki**

**Why It’s Great:** This is not just one of the most famous personal finance books of all time; it’s also one of the most mind-shifting. Kiyosaki tells the story of growing up with two father figures which include his real dad, who followed the traditional path of working hard for a paycheck, and his best friend’s dad, who built wealth through smart investing and entrepreneurship. Through these two lenses, Kiyosaki introduces key ideas like assets versus liabilities, the importance of financial education, and how the wealthy think differently about money. For teens, this book opens up a world of possibilities by challenging the idea that working a job is the only path to success. It lays the foundation for understanding passive income, long-term investing, and thinking like an owner rather than just an employee.
