As a high school student considering a career in finance, one of the biggest choices you’ll face is whether to attend a public or private university. While both types of schools can offer a strong education, they often differ in terms of cost, class size, resources, and career opportunities. So how do you choose what’s best for you?

Let’s break down the pros and cons of each, especially from the perspective of a future finance major.

## **Public Universities: Affordable and Accessible**

Public universities are funded in part by state governments, which is why they tend to be more affordable, especially for in-state students. If you're hoping to avoid large student loans, public schools can be a smart financial choice. Lower tuition doesn't necessarily mean lower quality. Many public universities have excellent business and finance programs, like the University of Michigan (Ross), Indiana University (Kelley), and the University of Texas at Austin (McCombs).Another major benefit of public schools is their size. Larger student populations mean a wider variety of clubs, student organizations, and networking opportunities. You may also have access to more course offerings, double majors, or interdisciplinary programs. However, because of their size, public universities can also feel less personal. It might be harder to build relationships with professors or get one-on-one support unless you actively seek it out.

## **Private Universities: Personalized and Prestigious**

Private universities, on the other hand, are funded through tuition and private donations. This usually means higher sticker prices, but also more generous financial aid, especially if the school is well-endowed. For some students, attending a private university can actually cost the same (or even less) than a public one, depending on the aid package.Private schools often offer smaller class sizes, which means more direct interaction with professors and a closer-knit campus community. This can be a huge advantage if you’re looking for mentorship or opportunities to do research or special projects. Many private universities also have strong alumni networks and name recognition, which can help when applying for internships or jobs at top finance firms.However, not all private universities are created equal. Just because a school is private doesn’t mean it’s automatically better. Be sure to look at the strength of its finance or business program, as well as how well it places students in internships and careers.

## **What Should Finance Students Consider?**

When it comes to studying finance, the quality of the program, internship access, and alumni support matter just as much as the name of the school. Public schools with strong business schools often have direct pipelines into Wall Street and major corporations. On the other hand, private schools might offer a more tailored educational experience and stronger personal networks.You should also think about location. Schools in or near major financial hubs (like New York, Chicago, or San Francisco) often give students easier access to internships, events, and networking opportunities, regardless of whether they’re public or private.

## **Final Takeaway**

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Public and private universities both have strengths and trade-offs, especially for finance students. What matters most is finding the school that fits your goals, budget, and learning style.Instead of asking, “Which type is better?” ask, “Where will I thrive, grow, and get the opportunities I need to succeed in finance?”
